This year I read 63 books (actually a couple more, as there were some I didn't log), & I tracked my reading with [StoryGraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/). This graph is so interesting; you can see the effect the fall & spring semesters have on my reading.

Some of the more engaging books I read this year include:

* *The Argonauts*. Maggie Nelson.
* *How to Be Normal*. Phil Christman.
* *Tradition & Apocalypse: An Essay on the Future of Christian Belief*. David Bentley Hart.
