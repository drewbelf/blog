This is one of my favorite exchanges in [C. S. Lewis's *The Great Divorce*](https://micro.blog/books/9780061947353). Here the "Big Man" (the first speaker) is insisting on his own decency in his earthly life---ironic considering the reader is introduced to the Big Man when he beats a man up to take his place in the line for the bus to Heaven---& how Heaven is therefore his "by rights." Len (his guide to Heaven & apparently a former employee of the Big Man's) keeps trying to dissuade him from thinking about Heaven as a matter of deserts.

This is something I encounter, semester after semester, in my studentsâ€™ thinking about Heaven & Hell: it must be a matter of what one deserves. But as Len himself notes, no one in Heaven gets what they deserve: "It's not so bad as that. I haven't got my rights, or I should not be here. You will not get yours either. You'll get something far better. Never fear." No one is really good enough to actually *deserve* the joys of Heaven; this is not so much a comment on the smallness of human goodness as a comment on the largeness of Heaven's joys.

If Heaven is a matter of being eternally enfolded into the love of God---into the love that *is* God---then it cannot be the case that Heaven is a matter of just deserts. That's not only because humans have a self-destructive tendency to turn from love when they encounter it (Len again: "You weren't a decent man & you didn't do your best. We none of us were & none of us did. Lord bless you, it doesn't matter"), but also because *that's not how love works*. Love is not something earned or merited: it is a gift, freely given & gratefully received.

To think about Heaven as something someone earns---as a reward for good behavior---is to go about it all wrong. But if we think about Heaven instead as God's offer of self in love, well, now we're on to something.
