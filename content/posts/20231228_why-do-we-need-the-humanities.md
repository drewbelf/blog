[Clarkson University announces plan to phase out majors in humanities, communications](https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/49014/20231222/clarkson-announces-plan-to-phase-out-majors-in-humanties-communications). 

> [Kelly] Chezum [Clarkson's vice president for external relations] said the university has always been focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The nine majors being phased out — social documentation, history, literature, sociology, film, political science, digital arts and sciences, communications and media, and interdisciplinary liberal studies and humanities — represent less than 2% of students.

Very often when programs in the humanities are cut, the cuts are justified---explicitly or not---by pointing out how few students will be affected by these cuts. The "vice president for external relations" here points out that Clarkson has historically been more of a STEM school anyway & that only a very small percentage of students are members of the programs being cut. The suggestion, then, is that Clarkson students aren't really getting hurt in all this---there are hardly any students choosing these majors in the first place, & those students will be allowed to finish their degreem programs before the programs are fully phased out. This sort of reasoning seems to be fairly typical when humanities are cut: students aren't majoring in the humanities, so why do we need them?

I find this kind of reasoning frustrating for a lot of reasons, chief among them that [there is more to a college education than vocational training](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/02/opinion/humanities-liberal-arts-policy-higher-education.html). In fairness to Clarkson it has not announced any plans to cut or scale back its general education curriculum, so its non-humanities students will have to take classes that are ordered to deep & critical thinking. But what does it say to a university's students when that university cuts its programs in the humanities---those fields that are primarily interested in questions of ultimate meaning & significance, particularly where human existence & shared life are concerned---about the importance of such questions?
