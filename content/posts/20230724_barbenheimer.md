I really enjoyed both *Barbie* & *Oppenheimer*; I plan to see both again soon, but some initial thoughts:

*Barbie* is just so fun to watch, start to finish. The production design is stunningly detailed, the writing is weird & funny, & Ryan Gosling & Margot Robbie both deliver wonderful performances---Gosling's wonderfully funny, & Robbie's wonderfully subtle. Greta Gerwig adds another film to [her already impressive](https://youtu.be/cNi_HC839Wo) [body of work](https://youtu.be/uoq3Ro4iGls) in this sensitive & delightful reflection on the human project of making meaning in the face of uncertainty & death.

That this is, apparently, only [the first of Mattel's own cinematic universe](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/10/after-barbie-mattel-is-raiding-its-entire-toybox) makes me more than a little queasy---& takes some of the bite out *Barbie*'s jokes at Mattel's expsnse---but I really, really enjoyed *Barbie* all the same.

I'm still thinking about *Oppenheimer*. Like much of Nolan's work it's grand & ambitious, but I worry it stumbles a bit under its own weight. Still, it is buoyed by several strong performances (chief among them Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey, Jr.) & visually & aurally stunning sequences. The nonlinear storytelling, while a staple for Nolan, I think did more to detract from than add to the film---though it did allow for an extremely powerful final scene. (I don't want to say much more than that, for folks who haven't seen it.) Especially now that I have a better sense of the plot in mind, I'll have to see it strikes me on a second viewing. I wasn't quite disappointed or letdown by the film, but neither did it quite have the impact I was anticipating.
