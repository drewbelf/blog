*It's a Wonderful Life* is not really about George Bailey. Neither is it really about Clarence or George's children or even Mary (though [attending to Mary does get us closer to the mark](https://www.thebulwark.com/there-is-no-mary-problem-in-its-a-wonderful-life/)). *It's a Wonderful Life* is not about any single person, & in fact, to view the film as though it is about one of its individual characters constitutes, in my view, a serious misreading of the film---it misses what makes life wonderful. The film is rather about the community that George spends most of his life complaining about: Bedford Falls.

One can be forgiven for this misreading---George is himself something of an egoist, & the film takes a seemingly singular interest in him---but I think it is important to correct this misreading. 

The film consistently affirms that any community is greater than the sum of its members. 

This is not in any way to detract from the dignity of the individual, a collectivism at the expense of the person. Rather, *It's a Wonderful Life* affirms that individual identity is found within community---sometimes even, as is the case with George, in a furstrated & frustrating tension with the community. 

What makes George's life wonderful, in the end, is not just his accomplishments or his family or his wife or whatever else.
