The season of Advent is a season of preparation, as Christians around the world make themselves ready for irruption of love and mercy into a dark and weary world and the transformation that irruption effects in individuals and in the world. Christmas celebrates this irruption, rejoicing that the LORD has seen fit to pitch his tent and dwell among us. But the season of Christmas is also, and importantly, a season of transformation. How does the irruption of love and mercy that is the incarnation reshape our lives in accordance with that same love and mercy who is the LORD?

*Les Misérables*---Victor Hugo's 1862 historical novel, popularized in the 1980 stage production and, more recently, Tom Hooper's film adaptation---is a story of such transformation, of the work of love and mercy working within a person to reform them. Each of the main characters in the story encounter this love and must reckon with its effect in their lives. 

On Christmas Day 2012 with my then girlfriend (now wife), I saw Tom Hooper's *Les Misérables* in theaters. I was only vaguely aware of the musical---I think I saw the trailer that featured part of Anne Hathaway's "I Dreamed a Dream"---but otherwise I was going in blind. What I discovered was an incredible story, about love and mercy, justice and transgression, and above all, conversion. Despite its quirks---Russell Crowe's lackluster performance, Sacha Baren Cohen's inconsistent accent, Eddie Redmayne's not-quite-nineteenth-century hair--- 

Exiting the theater, my girlfriend's sister's boyfriend (now, simply, my brother-in-law) quipped that Valjean---the central character---is little more than link that connects all the characters. He's the excuse for 

The transformative moment of conversion for Valjean his the gracious mercy he's shown by the local bishop. Valjean is recently released from prison; he's now serving a lifetime of parole. What landed him in prison was a virtuous act---stealing bread for his sister's starving child---but the years of prison, extended by several failed escape attempts, have hardened and embittered him. His parole means, even released from prison, he is not a free man; he must check in with his parole officer every month till he dies. What's more, he has found work as an ex-convict hard to come by; what work he can find doesn't pay a just wage. (Colm Wilkinson, the original Valjean in the stage production, spits, "This handful of tin couldn't buy my sweat!") Like many former prisoners, Valjean struggles to readjust to society. The bishop of Digne welcomes Valjean into his home, despite the protestations of his biological and a religious sister, offering him food, wine, and a warm bed for the night.

Yet Valjean, resentful of the society that took seventeen years and counting of his life, returns the bishop's kindness with treachery. He steals the bishop's silver plateware and escapes into the night. But Valjean is captured by the police and returned to the bishop; the police are eager to lock him back up as they tell the bishop, gleefully, of Valjean's audacious claim that the bishop *gave* him this silver. "That is right," the bishop quietly but firmly interjects. He dismisses the officers, thanking them for their service but standing by Valjean's claim. As the police turn to leave, the bishop pulls Valjean aside and tells him in no uncertain terms, "You must use this precious silver to become an honest man."

We must observe several things about the bishop's act here. First, it is entirely gratuitous, in that the bishop expects nothing in return. **must establish bishop scene as a Christmas event---gratuitous love, done with no expectation of return, but requiring something of Valjean; though it's in the past it continues to stick with and affect throughout in fits and starts**

The bishop's act of mercy sends Valjean into a spiral. He expresses shame at what he's become---"a thief in the night, a dog on the run"---and anger at a society that has so failed him; 

movement is: Les Mis is an Advent/Christmas story insofar as it is a story of conversion, of the transformation of the person by an irruption of love. bishop interaction represents a Christmas event. like the liturgical year, Valjean keeps coming back to this event and must continue to decide how he's going to allow that love to reshape him in love. Javert is the counterpoint, representing what happens when one rejects that love (tends toward self-annihilation)

**or maybe just say it's a Christmas story**
