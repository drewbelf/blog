The Oscars air tonight. I don't ordinarily pay so much attention to awards shows but I've seen all the films nominated in the main 6 categories. Here are my hopes & my predictions for those main 6 categories: lead actor, supporting actor, lead actress, supporting actress, director, & picture.

## Actor in a leading role

**Hope**: Jeffrey Wright, *American Fiction*

I enjoyed this movie pretty well, & it's the kind of movie I'd like to see recognized at the Oscars. Wright's performance was excellent: restrained even while exasperated, self-righteous but nevertheless flawed.

**Prediction**: Cillian Murphy, *Oppenheimer*

Murphy's widely praised performance is coming into the Oscars with a lot of momentum (as is *Oppenheimer* in general): he's won a Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA. & it was a remarkable performance, if a bit effortful. I'd be surprised if Murphy didn't win.

## Actor in a supporting role

**Hope**: Robert Downey, Jr., *Oppenheimer*

On this category, it's close for me between Robert De Niro in *Killers of the Flower Moon* & Downey. De Niro was incredible, but Downey really held my attention in a way De Niro didn't quite. I hope it goes to Downey.

**Prediction**: Robert Downey, Jr., *Oppenheimer*

Like his screen partner Murphy, Downey is coming into the Oscars with plenty of momentum (Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA). I think he's got the Oscar locked up.

## Actress in a leading role

**Hope**: Lily Gladstone,  *Killers of the Flower Moon*

Lily Gladstone stole every scene she was in, even when she didn't say a word---& this is in a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio & Robert De Niro. She delivered a heartbreaking & breathtaking performance, & she deserves the Oscar on the strength of her appearance in the film alone. If Gladstone doesn't win, it will be the biggest disservice of the night.

**Prediction**: 

This is a very difficulty category to predict; each of the nominees have *some*thing the Oscars love in a lead actress. I *think* it will go to Gladstone, but I think there's a possibility it goes to Emma Stone
