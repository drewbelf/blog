Here I rank the Oscars nominees for Best Picture, from least favorite to favorite.

## 10. Maestro

Everything about Bradley Cooper's Leonard Bernstein biopic just felt so effortful, especially the performances. I have little to say about it because the film was just so uninteresting.

## 9. The Zone of Interest

While I appreciated some features of Jonathan Glazer's exploration of the mundane evil of the Holocaust, the film as a whole felt empty. (Maybe that was the idea.)

## 8. Poor Things

I cannot understand the enthusiasm this film garnered. Yorgos Lanthimos's riff on *Frankenstein*, while delightful to look at & entertaining at times, is so singularly interested in Bella's sexual liberation at the almost utter exclusion of any other aspect of her that the film ends up being tedious & thin. I wanted to like it much more than I did.

## 7. Anatomy of a Fall

I liked Justine Triet's courtroom drama; it reminded me, at times, of Albert Camus's *The Stranger*. Especially riveting was the incredibly grim but also totally accurate fight between Sandra & her husband.

## 6. American Fiction

I really enjoyed this satire of the expectations the publishing world (& entertainment culture more broadly) burdens Black artists with. It often felt less like a single story than two different stories spliced together, which unfortunately left the film as a whole a little disjointed. Jeffrey Wright's performance is amazing. I don't think he'll win Best Actor, but I think he should.

## 5. The Holdovers

Alexander Payne's holiday film, about a group of misfits stuck together for the Christmas break, is really fun. I can't remember who said it, but some critic put it well when they said: I've seen this movie a thousand times before, but this is the best version of this movie. It's hard to imagine how the Academy could *not* award Da'Vine Joy Randolph with Best Supporting Actress.

## 4. Oppenheimer

While I still stand by [my initial feelings](https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/posts/20230724_barbenheimer/)---it buckles a bit under its own weight---Christopher Nolan's biopic of the architect of the atomic bomb still has thrilling & wrenching moments. The two timelines don't quite hang together & the movie suffers as a result, though the nonlinear approach does allow Nolan to end on the most affecting scene. I think *Oppenheimer* will win Best Picture (along with most of the awards its received nominations for).

## 3. Past Lives

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Celine Song's story of lost & rediscovered love. The final few moments are simultaneously heartbreaking & hopeful. Greta Lee is wonderful, as is John Magaro.

## 2. Barbie

Greta Gerwig is such an incredible director, finding depths of love & humanity in even the most mundane settings: [the bickering between a mother & daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNi_HC839Wo), [the struggles of & pressures felt by a family of women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AST2-4db4ic), & now even the "coming-of-age" of a plastic doll. Margot Robbie delivers a wonderfully subtle performance, inviting us to consider the ways we make meaning, in ways both helpful & harmful, in the world. I'd love to see more collaboration between Gerwig & Robbie (but not, please God, in a *Barbie* sequel).

## 1. Killers of the Flower Moon

Martin Scorsese's crime drama, about prowling wolves devouring the land & its Osage inhabitants, is a brilliant film. Despite the film's length, Scorsese held my interest the entire time, thanks in no small part to the stunning cinematography & excellent performances. Lily Gladstone's deserves to be named Best Actress, & this film deserves Best Picture. The final scene, with Martin Scorsese's cameo, brilliantly reframes the entire film & calls himself---& the audience---to account. No one does violence, evil, & calls to repentance like Scorsese.
