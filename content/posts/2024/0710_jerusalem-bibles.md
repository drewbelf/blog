In 1943, Pope Pius XII promulgated *[Divino afflante Spiritu](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_30091943_divino-afflante-spiritu.html)*, encouraging the translation of the Bible on the basis of original Hebrew & Greek texts. Prior to *Divino afflante Spiritu* the Latin Vulgate had served as the textual basis for Catholic translations of the Bible; this new directive from the pope inaugurated the modern era of Catholic biblical scholarship.

The French Dominicans at the École Biblique in Jerusalem answered the call, publishing a French translation of the Bible---*La Bible de Jérusalem*---in 1956.[^1] In addition to the text itself, *La Bible de Jérusalem* offered scholarly introductions to each book & extensive notes to the text. Ten years later an English translation---the Jerusalem Bible---appeared. More a translation of the French text of *La Bible de Jérusalem* than the Hebrew & Greek, the primary contribution of the Jerusalem Bible was to make available French biblical scholarship to an English readership. Still, as the first complete translation of the Bible into modern English, the Jerusalem Bible was received eagerly among English-speaking Catholics (& even some Protestants).

Still, advances in biblical scholarship & a need for a proper translation of the Hebrew & Greek texts called for an update to the Jerusalem Bible. In 1985 the New Jerusalem Bible appeared, translating directly the Hebrew & Greek texts while still taking inspiration from the French edition.

Then, in the early 2000s, the African bishops asked for a more affordable edition of the Jerusalem Bible, which brought to light the need for another update to the New Jerusalem Bible. The fruit of that update is the Revised New Jerusalem Bible, published recently (2019) by [Darton, Longman & Todd](https://www.dltbibles.com/the-rnjb) under the direction of Henry Wansbrough. The RNJB was produced according to the following three principles:

1. The text should be translated with an ear more for proclamation aloud than silent reading.
2. The translation should be produced according to a philosophy of formal equivalence rather than dynamic equivalence.
3. The translation should reflect the fact that the biblical message is addressed to women & men alike.

While I've not spent much time with it, I've recently become very interested in the Jerusalem Bible tradition of biblical translations. Considering this translation came about as a response to *Divino afflante Spiritu* & so originates in a solely Catholic initiative,[^2] the Jerusalem Bible strikes me as a quintessentially Catholic tradition of translation, produced during a period of renewal in Catholic theology.[^3] From what I understand (& in my own limited experience reading translations in this tradition) it enjoys a better reputation for its literary quality than, say, the New Revised Standard Version or the New American Bible (Revised Edition). Could the Revised New Jerusalem Bible be the end of my search for a preferred Bible translation?[^4]

I began to look more carefully at the RNJB I bought a year or two ago, & I wondered at how its translation compared to the NJB (whose literary quality & theological richness is celebrated). I especially wondered how the shift from the dynamic equivalence of the NJB (meaning-for-meaning) to the formal equivalence (word-for-word) of the RNJB affected the translation. So I decided to compare some passages.

## Genesis 1:1--3

| New Jerusalem Bible | Revised New Jerusalem Bible |
|---|---|
| In the beginning God created heaven & earth. | In the beginning God created heaven & earth. |
| Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, with a divine wind sweeping over the waters. | Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, with the spirit of God sweeping over the waters. |
| God said, 'Let there be light,' & there was light. | God said, 'Let there be light,' & there was light. |

Very similar. I kind of like the NJB's "a divine wind" over the RNJB's "spirit of God."

## Exodus 3:7--14

| New Jerusalem Bible | Revised New Jerusalem Bible |
|---|---|
| Yahweh then said, 'I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I  have heard them crying for help on account of their taskmasters. Yes, I  am well aware of their sufferings. | Then the LORD said, 'I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying for help because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings, |
| & I have come down to rescue them from the clutches of the Egyptians  & bring them up out of that country, to a country rich & broad, to a  country flowing with milk & honey, to the home of the Canaanites, the  Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites & the Jebusites. | & I have come down to rescue them from the hands of the Egyptians & bring them up out of that land, to a land rich & broad, a land flowing with milk & honey, the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites & the Jebusites. |
| Yes indeed, the Israelites' cry for help has reached me, & I have also  seen the cruel way in which the Egyptians are oppressing them. | Now see, the Israelites' cry for help has reached me, & I have also seen the oppression which the Egyptians are inflicting upon them. |
| So now I am sending you to Pharaoh, for you to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.' | So come now, I am sending you to Pharaoh, to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.' |
| Moses said to God, 'Who am I to go to Pharaoh & bring the Israelites out of Egypt?' | Moses said to God, 'Who am I to go to Pharaoh, to bring the Israelites out of Egypt?' |
| 'I shall be with you,' God said, 'and this is the sign by which you will  know that I was the one who sent you. After you have led the people out  of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.' | God said, 'I shall be with you, & this is the sign by which you will know that it was I who sent you. After you have led the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.' |
| Moses then said to God, 'Look, if I go to the Israelites & say to  them, "The God of your ancestors has sent me to you," & they say to  me, "What is his name?" what am I to tell them?' | Moses then said to God, 'Look, if I go to the Israelites & say to them, "The God of your ancestors has sent me to you," & they say to me, "What is his name?", what shall I say to them?' |
| God said to Moses, 'I am he who is.' & he said, 'This is what you are to say to the Israelites, "I am has sent me to you."' | God said to Moses, 'I am who I am.' & he said, 'This is what you are to say to the Israelites, "I am has sent me to you."' |

You can see here the RNJB's "reading aloud" principle in the way it avoids quotations without first introducing the speaker. Again I like some of the NJB's phrases ("from the clutches of the Egyptians"), but the use of "the LORD" for the tetragrammaton is a massive improvement on the part of the RNJB.

## Matthew 6:9--13

| New Jerusalem Bible | Revised New Jerusalem Bible |
|---|---|
| Our Father in heaven, may your name be held holy, | Our Father in heaven, may your name be held holy, |
| your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as in heaven. | your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as in heaven. |
| Give us today our daily bread. | Give us today our daily bread. |
| & forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven those who are in debt to us. | & forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven our debtors. |
| & do not put us to the test, but save us from the Evil One. | & do not put us to the test, but save us from the Evil One. |

The Lord's Prayer that I have memorized is, I think, a slightly modernized form of the one appearing in the King James Version ("Our Father, who art in heaven ..."). That language is so familiar to me, I can't help but feel a little uncomfortable reading this one. But I do kind of like the use of "debts" here rather than "trespasses."

## Luke 1:46--55

| New Jerusalem Bible | Revised New Jerusalem Bible |
|---|---|
| 'My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord | 'My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord |
| & my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour; | & my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour; |
| because he has looked upon the humiliation of his servant. Yes, from now onwards all generations will call me blessed, | since he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant. For see, from now on all generations will call me blessed, |
| for the Almighty has done great things for me. Holy is his name, | for the Almighty has done great things for me, & holy is his name, |
| & his faithful love extends age after age to those who fear him. | & his mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear him. |
| He has used the power of his arm, he has routed the arrogant of heart. | He has exerted the power of his arm, he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their heart. |
| He has pulled down princes from their thrones & raised high the lowly. | He has taken down princes from thrones & raised up the lowly. |
| He has filled the starving with good things, sent the rich away empty. | He has filled the hungry with good things, & sent the rich away empty. |
| He has come to the help of Israel his servant, mindful of his faithful love | He has come to the help of Israel his servant, in remembrance of his mercy, |
| ---according to the promise he made to our ancestors---of his mercy to Abraham & to his descendants for ever.' | according to the promise he made to our ancestors, of his mercy to Abraham & his descendants for ever.' |

Some lines I prefer the NJB ("he has routed the arrogant of heart") & some I prefer the RNJB ("he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant"). I wonder what Greek word underlies what the NJB translates as "faithful love" & what the RNJB translates "mercy"?

## John 1:1--5, 14

| New Jerusalem Bible | Revised New Jerusalem Bible |
|---|---|
| In the beginning was the Word: the Word was with God & the Word was God. | In the beginning was the Word: the Word was with God & the Word was God. |
| He was with God in the beginning. | He was with God in the beginning. |
| Through him all things came into being, not one thing came into being except through him. | Through him all things came into being, not one thing came into being except through him. |
| What has come into being in him was life, life that was the light of men; | What has come into being in him was life, life that was the light of all people; |
| & light shines in darkness, & darkness could not overpower it. | & light shines in darkness, & darkness could not overpower it. |
| The Word became flesh, he lived among us, & we saw his glory, the  glory that he has from the Father as only Son of the Father, full of  grace & truth. | The Word became flesh & lived among us, & we saw his glory, the glory as of an only-begotten Son of the Father, full of grace & truth. |

John's Prologue reads as nearly identical in both translations, with the only substantial difference being the preference for inclusive language ("people" rather than "men") in verse 4.

## John 3:16

| New Jerusalem Bible | Revised New Jerusalem Bible |
|---|---|
|For this is how God loved the world: he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life. |For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life. |

I have to say, I don't particularly like how either version translates the first half of this verse; I prefer the KJV's "For God so loved the world ...", but that may be because it's familiar (like the Lord's Prayer above)

## Philippians 2:5--11

| New Jerusalem Bible | Revised New Jerusalem Bible |
|---|---|
| Make your own the mind of Christ Jesus: | Let the same mind be in you as was also in Christ Jesus: |
| Who, being in the form of God, did not count equality with God something to be grasped. | Who, being in the form of God, did not count equality with God something to be grasped. |
| But he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming as human beings are; & being in every way like a human being, | But he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, born in human likeness, & found in human shape; |
| he was humbler yet, even to accepting death, death on a cross. | he humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, death on a cross. |
| & for this God raised him high, & gave him the name which is above all other names; | & therefore God highly exalted him, & granted him the name above every name |
| so that all beings in the heavens, on earth & in the underworld, should bend the knee at the name of Jesus | so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend of beings heavenly, earthly, & under the earth, |
| & that every tongue should acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord, to the glory of God the Father. | & every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. |

Here I think we see more sharply the differences between dynamic & formal equivalence. Compare especially verses 7 & 8. I think the NJB's "But he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming as human beings are; & being in every way like a human being, he was humbler yet, even to accepting death, death on a cross" reads much more nicely than the RNJB's, but I take it the RNJB is closer to the Greek.[^5]

## Conclusions

Acknowledging that these comparisons are far from exhaustive, it doesn't seem like the shift from dynamic to formal equivalence has had a huge impact on translation choices, with some relatively small exceptions. With those exceptions in mind I have to say that I tend to prefer the NJB's renderings to the RNJB,[^6] though the inclusive language of the RNJB & the use of "the LORD" for the tetragrammaton are points in favor of the RNJB.

Is the (R)NJB my new preferred translation? Maybe for now. I'd like to do a more extensive comparison of the (R)NJB to other versions, especially the English Standard Version - Catholic Edition & the Knox Version, before making any final determinations. But that's a project for another day.

[^1]: These details are drawn largely from Henry Wansbrough's Foreword to the *Revised New Jerusalem Bible: Study Edition* (Image Books, 2019).
[^2]: Many---perhaps even most---modern English translations began as Protestant translations, which were then adapted for Catholic use (e.g., the Catholic edition of the Revised Standard Version). Exceptions might include the Confraternity Bible---which is really an update of the Douay Rheims Bible---& the New American Bible.
[^3]: I have in mind the so-called *nouvelle théologie* / *ressourcement* movement. It makes me wonder if any of the theologians of this movement---Chenu, de Lubac, etc.---ever commented on *La Bible de Jérusalem*/Jerusalem Bible.
[^4]: Someday I might like to write a fuller post on what I'm looking for in an English Bible. I really like the [Knox version](https://catholicbible.online/knox/OT), though it is at times a little too idiosyncratic. Offhand I think my desiderata include: (1) a Catholic Bible; (2) that reads well in English; (3) without being too loose with respect to the Hebrew & Greek; & (4) with language that is not so idiosyncratic as to be unrecognizable to non-Catholic Christians.
[^5]: I don't know Greek so I can't check myself, but the RNJB sounds closer to most modern English translations that also proceed according to formal equivalence.
[^6]: I do think there's a place for dynamic equivalence translations, especially in private devotional reading, so long as it does not become too unmoored from the original texts.
