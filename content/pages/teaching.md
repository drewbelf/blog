To study theology is to ask questions about God & things pertaining to God, & to think critically about possible answers. Students of theology don’t do this unaided; in the archive that is the history of Christian theology sits an enormous catalog of methods, questions, approaches, answers, & discussions from a diversity of thinkers, traditions, & communities.

My teaching aims, in part, to show students how to explore that archive & put its materials to use as they navigate these fundamental questions of human existence & divine reality. In this way, I convey to my students the wide diversity of Christian thinking about God while also modeling intellectual work as always embedded in communities or traditions.
		
Ultimately, as a teacher I invite my students to inhabit, if only provisionally, these communities of thinking about God: asking their questions, assessing their answers, & communicating these ideas effectively.
		
I teach courses on Francis & Clare of Assisi & Catholic theology for SBU’s [undergraduate curriculum](https://www.sbu.edu/academics/general-education-curriculum), along with courses for [majors & minors](https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies) in theology & Franciscan studies. During the spring semester I’ll be teaching a couple sections of “The Way of Francis & Clare” & a couple sections of “Catholic Theology,” both of which I've taught before. In addition to those, I’ve also taught the following courses:
		
* Jesus through the Centuries;
* Bonaventure---Life & Writings;
* Early Christian History to the Reformation; &
* Intermediate Latin.

Next academic year I'm hoping to teach a course on theology & film, which I designed during this past fall semester.
