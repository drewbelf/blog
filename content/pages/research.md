My research specialties include **medieval theology** (particularly **early mendicant theologies**) & **christology**. I also have research interests in soteriology, poverty, apocalypticism (medieval & contemporary), & trinitarian theology.

I’m currently preparing for publication a **monograph** on the christology of the *Summa halensis*, a collaborative work of the Franciscans at the University of Paris during the early 1240s. In this book, tentatively titled *Christ the Penitent: The Early Franciscans & Scholastic Theology*, I intend to show how the *fratres* developed what I have come to call a ‘penitential christology’: Christ makes satisfaction for sin not by dying, but by feeling contrition at human sin.
		
In addition to presenting the key commitments & emphases of this early Franciscan reflection on Christ & his work, this study will also consider the place of the *Summa halensis* in the development of scholastic christology more broadly. This monograph will revise & extend the research begun in [my doctoral dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/foundations-scholastic-christology-em-summa/docview/2629099977/se-2?accountid=45220), “Foundations of Scholastic Christology in the *Summa halensis*.”
		
I’m also in the process of **translating** Book III of Alexander of Hales’s *Glossa* on Peter Lombard’s *Four Books of Sentences* for [Dallas Medieval Texts & Translations](https://dallasmedievaltexts.org/alexander-of-hales-project/). I’m producing this translation in collaboration with [Eric Mabry](http://www.stmarys.edu/seminary/faculty/dr-eric-mabry/) of St. Mary’s Seminary & University. Alexander was among the first masters at the University of Paris to incorporate the Lombard’s *Sentences* into his curriculum, making him an important & authoritative teacher of what would become the standard textbook for theologians during the medieval period.
		
And, I serve the journal *[Franciscan Studies](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/457)* as [its **book review editor**](https://www.sbu.edu/academics/academic-resources/franciscan-institute/franciscan-institute-leadership-team). If you have a title you would like to see reviewed in *Franciscan Studies* or if you would like to review a title, please contact me at abelfiel at sbu dot edu.
