On this blog you will find five types of posts. First is [**opinion**](/tags/opinion/), in which I offer my thoughts on news & current events. Second is [**criticism**](/tags/criticism/), in which I offer commentary on literature, film, TV, & other media. Third is [**speculation**](/tags/speculation/), in which I ruminate over theological ideas & questions. Fourth is [**reflection**](/tags/reflection/), in which I reflect on my life & work. Fifth is [**logbook**](/tags/logbook/), in which I keep monthly logs of what I'm reading & watching. Each post will be tagged with one (but not more than one) of these five tags, plus whichever topics are relevant to the post. You can also view [a full list of tags](/tags/).

I take the title of this blog from the *Itinerarium mentis in deum*, a guidebook for union with God written by one of the great medieval theologians of the Franciscan order, Bonaventure of Bagnoregio. In [Regis Armstrong’s English translation](https://micro.blog/books/9780813233000), this blog is “the vigilance of a poor one in the wilderness.”

It is a bit presumptuous, I admit, for me to suggest my blog is anything like Bonaventure’s *speculationes* on his *pauper*, Francis of Assisi. The title reflects less a present reality than a future aspiration: that my own watchfulness outside of myself, within myself, & above myself might approach Bonaventure’s (diachronically, if not at every moment) & that my life might more closely resemble Francis’s own life of penance, poverty, & humility.
