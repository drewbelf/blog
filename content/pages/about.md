Hi---I’m Andrew Belfield, & I’m an assistant professor of theology & Franciscan studies at St. Bonaventure University. I think of this blog as an online record of what I’m reading, what I’m thinking about, & what I’m seeing: somewhere between a commonplace book, a journal, & a scrapbook, I suppose.

I take the title of this blog from the Itinerarium mentis in deum, a guidebook for union with God written by one of the great medieval theologians of the Franciscan order, Bonaventure of Bagnoregio. In Regis Armstrong’s English translation, this blog is “the vigilance of a poor one in the wilderness.”

It is a bit presumptuous, I admit, for me to suggest my blog is anything like Bonaventure’s speculationes on his pauper, Francis of Assisi. The title reflects less a present reality than a future aspiration: that my own watchfulness outside of myself, within myself, & above myself might approach Bonaventure’s (diachronically, if not at every moment) & that my life might more closely resemble Francis’s own life of penance, poverty, & humility.
