Hi---I’m [Andrew Belfield](https://andrewbelfield.com), & I’m [an assistant professor of theology & Franciscan studies at St. Bonaventure University](https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies/faculty/belfield-andrew-gertner).

I take the title of this blog from the *Itinerarium mentis in deum*, a guidebook for union with God written by one of the great medieval theologians of the Franciscan order, Bonaventure of Bagnoregio. In [Regis Armstrong’s English translation](https://micro.blog/books/9780813233000), this blog is “the vigilance of a poor one in the wilderness.”

It is a bit presumptuous, I admit, for me to suggest my blog is anything like Bonaventure’s speculationes on his pauper, Francis of Assisi. The title reflects less a present reality than a future aspiration: that my own watchfulness outside of myself, within myself, & above myself might approach Bonaventure’s (diachronically, if not at every moment) & that my life might more closely resemble Francis’s own life of penance, poverty, & humility.
