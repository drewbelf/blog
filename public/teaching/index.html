            <p>To study theology is to ask questions about God &amp; things pertaining to God, &amp; to think critically about possible answers. Students of theology don’t do this unaided; in the archive that is the history of Christian theology sits an enormous catalog of methods, questions, approaches, answers, &amp; discussions from a diversity of thinkers, traditions, &amp; communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/R_P_Alexandri_de_Hales_primi_inter_minor/6bvr4x05_PQC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0&amp;kptab=overview" target="_blank"><img src="/teaching.webp" alt="Bonaventure & Thomas Aquinas in Alexander of Halesʼs classroom"></a></p>
<p>My teaching aims, in part, to show students how to explore that archive &amp; put its materials to use as they navigate these fundamental questions of human existence &amp; divine reality. In this way, I convey to my students the wide diversity of Christian thinking about God while also modeling intellectual work as always embedded in communities or traditions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as a teacher I invite my students to inhabit, if only provisionally, these communities of thinking about God: asking their questions, assessing their answers, &amp; communicating these ideas effectively.</p>
<p>I teach courses on Francis &amp; Clare of Assisi &amp; Catholic theology for SBU’s <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/general-education-curriculum" target="_blank">undergraduate curriculum</a>, along with courses for <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies" target="_blank">majors &amp; minors</a> in theology &amp; Franciscan studies. During the spring semester I’ll be teaching a couple sections of “The Way of Francis &amp; Clare” &amp; a couple sections of “Catholic Theology,” both of which I&rsquo;ve taught before. In addition to those, I’ve also taught the following courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus through the Centuries;</li>
<li>Bonaventure&mdash;Life &amp; Writings;</li>
<li>Early Christian History to the Reformation; &amp;</li>
<li>Intermediate Latin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next academic year I&rsquo;m hoping to teach a course on theology &amp; film, which I designed during this past fall semester.</p>
