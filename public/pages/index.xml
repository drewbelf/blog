      <description>On this blog you will find five types of posts. First is opinion, in which I offer my thoughts on news &amp;amp; current events. Second is criticism, in which I offer commentary on literature, film, TV, &amp;amp; other media. Third is speculation, in which I ruminate over theological ideas &amp;amp; questions. Fourth is reflection, in which I reflect on my life &amp;amp; work. Fifth is logbook, in which I keep monthly logs of what I&amp;rsquo;m reading &amp;amp; watching.</description>
