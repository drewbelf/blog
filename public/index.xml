      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a fair amount of hand wringing over Fiducia supplicans where the consistency of church teaching &amp;amp; papal authority are concerned. The concern goes something like this: Pope Francis, while reaffirming the Catholic church&amp;rsquo;s historical teaching on marriage (as possible only between a woman &amp;amp; a man), has allowed for the blessing of a same-sex couple (but not their relationship). This means the Catholic church will have to either forge ahead, perhaps revising its understanding of marriage to include same-sex unions, or pull back from Fiducia supplicans to reaffirm its historical understanding of marriage.</description>

According to an early biographer,2 “so thoroughly did the humility of the incarnation &amp;amp; the charity of the passion occupy his memory that he scarcely wanted to think of anything else.</description>

      <description>Hi&amp;mdash;I’m Andrew Belfield, &amp;amp; I’m an assistant professor of theology &amp;amp; Franciscan studies at St. Bonaventure University. I think of this blog as an online record of what I’m reading, what I’m thinking about, &amp;amp; what I’m seeing: somewhere between a commonplace book, a journal, &amp;amp; a scrapbook, I suppose.
I take the title of this blog from the Itinerarium mentis in deum, a guidebook for union with God written by one of the great medieval theologians of the Franciscan order, Bonaventure of Bagnoregio.</description>
