      <description>Fiducia supplicans presents itself as &amp;ldquo;an innovative contribution to the pastoral meaning of blessings, permitting a broadening &amp;amp; enrichment of the classical understanding of blessings&amp;rdquo; (emphasis original). I have already said something about how this &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo; might fit into a Catholic theological project, particularly where doctrinal development is concerned. I&amp;rsquo;d like now to comment more broadly on the document itself &amp;amp; what it has to say about blessings of couples. My main takeaway from Fiducia supplicans is that all persons &amp;amp; couples, including but not only those couples whose relationships do not conform to the church&amp;rsquo;s expectations, stand in need of God&amp;rsquo;s love &amp;amp; mercy, &amp;amp; so spontaneous, frequent, &amp;amp; abundant blessing of all persons &amp;amp; couples ought to be a regular feature of the church&amp;rsquo;s life as &amp;ldquo;sacrament of God&amp;rsquo;s infinite love&amp;rdquo; (ยง43).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a fair amount of hand wringing over Fiducia supplicans where the consistency of church teaching &amp;amp; papal authority are concerned. The concern goes something like this: Fiducia supplicans, signed by Pope Francis, reaffirms the Catholic church&amp;rsquo;s historical teaching on marriage (as possible only between a woman &amp;amp; a man) while allowing for blessings of couples who do not conform to that teaching of marriage. This means the Catholic church will have to either forge ahead, perhaps revising its understanding of marriage to include partnerships between persons of the same gender, or pull back from Fiducia supplicans to reaffirm its historical understanding of marriage.</description>
