      <description>(Well, not quite Theology 101; rather, Theology &amp;amp; Franciscan Studies 101, which isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly an intro to theology.)
I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting close to a &amp;ldquo;final form&amp;rdquo; for my sections of &amp;ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp;amp; Clare.” The course schedule, including reading assignments, is mostly set, but what&amp;rsquo;s really tied together the entire course is the integration of a service learning project throughout the semester.
Throughout the semester, students take what they learn about Franciscan values to design, plan, &amp;amp; implement a service project that does some good for the local community.</description>

      <description>How to teach a course on Francis &amp;amp; Clare of Assisi?1 The 101 class offered by the Department of Theology &amp;amp; Franciscan Studies at St. Bonaventure University is titled “The Way of Francis &amp;amp; Clare.” This course aims to introduce students to the Franciscan roots that underlie the mission &amp;amp; values of SBU by a semester-long study of the lives &amp;amp; writings of Francis &amp;amp; Clare.
Teaching such a course is not without its challenges.</description>
