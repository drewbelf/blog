        One of the particular challenges of teaching theology today&mdash;even to students who have some religious background&mdash;is the utter lack of theological formation most people in the United States receive. Some students may come in with some religious formation, in that they have participated in their church&rsquo;s faith formation classes or even theology classes in a religious high school, but that formation tends to be more catechetical than theological. To oversimplify, catechesis provides a student with a religious community&rsquo;s answers to theological questions, but it does not always provide the rationale for those answers.

        Clarkson University announces plan to phase out majors in humanities, communications.
[Kelly] Chezum [Clarkson&rsquo;s vice president for external relations] said the university has always been focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The nine majors being phased out — social documentation, history, literature, sociology, film, political science, digital arts and sciences, communications and media, and interdisciplinary liberal studies and humanities — represent less than 2% of students.
Very often when programs in the humanities are cut, the cuts are justified&mdash;explicitly or not&mdash;by pointing out how few students will be affected by these cuts.

        (Well, not quite Theology 101; rather, Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies 101, which isn&rsquo;t exactly an intro to theology.)
I&rsquo;m finally getting close to a &ldquo;final form&rdquo; for my sections of &ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” The course schedule, including reading assignments, is mostly set, but what&rsquo;s really tied together the entire course is the integration of a service learning project throughout the semester.
Throughout the semester, students take what they learn about Franciscan values to design, plan, &amp; implement a service project that does some good for the local community.

        How to teach a course on Francis &amp; Clare of Assisi?1 The 101 class offered by the Department of Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies at St. Bonaventure University is titled “The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” This course aims to introduce students to the Franciscan roots that underlie the mission &amp; values of SBU by a semester-long study of the lives &amp; writings of Francis &amp; Clare.
Teaching such a course is not without its challenges.
