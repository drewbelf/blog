      <description>Holy Week of any year&amp;mdash;that week of prayer &amp;amp; fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb—always has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, &amp;amp; religious communities.</description>

      <description>Good &amp;amp; gracious God,
you who are power &amp;amp; wisdom &amp;amp; goodness—
Bless this tree,
a sign of life &amp;amp; freshness &amp;amp; perseverance in our midst.
May it stand as a reminder
of light in the dark of night,
and of life in the dead of winter.
May its supple branches &amp;amp; sharp, sweet scent
keep fresh in our minds &amp;amp; our hands
the mercy &amp;amp; generosity you show
in all your dealings with your beloved people.</description>
