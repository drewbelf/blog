        In which I watched Killers of the Flower Moon, The Blair Witch Project, &amp; The Killing of a Sacred Deer; &amp; read Questioning God, Ways of Seeing, Revelations of Divine Love, &amp; Julian of Norwich, Theologian.
Killers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023). What an amazing film. I don&rsquo;t even want to say much about it here, because I know I can&rsquo;t do it justice in the space of a short paragraph.

        I thought it might be fun at the end of each month to list the movies I&rsquo;d seen that month &amp; some thoughts about each.
Rope (Alfred Hitchcock, 1948). Jacqueline &amp; I decided to watch some Hitchcock in honor of Halloween at the end of the month. We&rsquo;ve seen a few Hitchcock already, but not Rope. I enjoyed it, though it&rsquo;s not my favorite of his (that remains Psycho). I love good, long scenes, &amp; Hitchcock&rsquo;s clever camera work to make the entire film seem like a single take really ratchets up the tension.

        I admire the aim in Elizabeth Johnson&rsquo;s Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&rsquo;s life, death, &amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp; while I don&rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&rsquo;s life (natal &amp; risen) &amp; his death don&rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.

        Inspired by Phil Christman&rsquo;s recent post of the same name, here&rsquo;s a list of a few things you would read if you wanted to figure out what I get out of Christianity.
Here&rsquo;s Christman&rsquo;s own disclaimer regarding his list, which I also make for my own:
 This is not, by the way, a canon or an attempt at canon-making. It’s extremely personal, and reflects my personal circumstances, which are narrow, like everyone’s.

        This year I read 63 books (actually a couple more, as there were some I didn&rsquo;t log), &amp; I tracked my reading with StoryGraph. This graph is so interesting; you can see the effect the fall &amp; spring semesters have on my reading.
Some of the more engaging books I read this year include:
 Transforming Fire: Imagining Christian Teaching. Mark D. Jordan. The Argonauts. Maggie Nelson. How to Be Normal.
