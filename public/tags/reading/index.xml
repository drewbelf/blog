      <description>I admire the aim in Elizabeth Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&amp;rsquo;s life, death, &amp;amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp;amp; while I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&amp;rsquo;s life (natal &amp;amp; risen) &amp;amp; his death don&amp;rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&amp;rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Phil Christman&amp;rsquo;s recent post of the same name, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of a few things you would read if you wanted to figure out what I get out of Christianity.
Here&amp;rsquo;s Christman&amp;rsquo;s own disclaimer regarding his list, which I also make for my own:
 This is not, by the way, a canon or an attempt at canon-making. It’s extremely personal, and reflects my personal circumstances, which are narrow, like everyone’s.</description>

      <description>This year I read 63 books (actually a couple more, as there were some I didn&amp;rsquo;t log), &amp;amp; I tracked my reading with StoryGraph. This graph is so interesting; you can see the effect the fall &amp;amp; spring semesters have on my reading.
Some of the more engaging books I read this year include:
 Transforming Fire: Imagining Christian Teaching. Mark D. Jordan. The Argonauts. Maggie Nelson. How to Be Normal.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I saw a tweet floating around asking for your &amp;ldquo;personal canon,&amp;rdquo; that is, which are the books that you have used to understand the world? Limiting myself only to written works (and not, say, music or film), here&amp;rsquo;s what I would say, roughly ordered according to when I encountered these books:
 The gospel according to Luke The book of Revelation A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens Les Misérables by Victor Hugo Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander by Thomas Merton Proslogion by Anselm of Canterbury The Plague by Albert Camus The Prophets by Abraham J.</description>
