        In the eighth episode of Beef, in one of a series of flashbacks filling in the backstories of the two beefing protagonists (or, better, the two antagonists), we see a particularly affecting scene between Danny &amp; his younger brother, Paul that illustrates what Thomas Merton calls &ldquo;the pattern &amp; prototype of all sin.&rdquo; (Spoilers follow.)
Danny &amp; Paul are at their parents’ motel: Danny is perhaps 20 or 21 years old &amp; working as his parents’ handyman (contractor, he insists), while Paul, three years his junior, is preparing his college applications.

        Fiducia supplicans presents itself as &ldquo;an innovative contribution to the pastoral meaning of blessings, permitting a broadening &amp; enrichment of the classical understanding of blessings&rdquo; (emphasis original). I have already said something about how this &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; might fit into a Catholic theological project, particularly where doctrinal development is concerned. I&rsquo;d like now to comment more broadly on the document itself &amp; what it has to say about blessings of couples. My main takeaway from Fiducia supplicans is that all persons &amp; couples, including but not only those couples whose relationships do not conform to the church&rsquo;s expectations, stand in need of God&rsquo;s love &amp; mercy, &amp; so spontaneous, frequent, &amp; abundant blessing of all persons &amp; couples ought to be a regular feature of the church&rsquo;s life as &ldquo;sacrament of God&rsquo;s infinite love&rdquo; (§43).

        I&rsquo;ve seen a fair amount of hand wringing over Fiducia supplicans where the consistency of church teaching &amp; papal authority are concerned. The concern goes something like this: Fiducia supplicans, signed by Pope Francis, reaffirms the Catholic church&rsquo;s historical teaching on marriage (as possible only between a woman &amp; a man) while allowing for blessings of couples who do not conform to that teaching of marriage. This means the Catholic church will have to either forge ahead, perhaps revising its understanding of marriage to include partnerships between persons of the same gender, or pull back from Fiducia supplicans to reaffirm its historical understanding of marriage.

        It was winter in Italy, eight hundred years ago, &amp; Assisi’s poverello had an idea.1 Francis of Assisi had become obsessed with the words &amp; deeds of Jesus Christ, his rustic parables &amp; simple gestures that, despite (or perhaps because of) their lowliness, communicated divine majesty &amp; awe. According to an early biographer,2 “so thoroughly did the humility of the incarnation &amp; the charity of the passion occupy his memory that he scarcely wanted to think of anything else.

        (Well, not quite Theology 101; rather, Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies 101, which isn&rsquo;t exactly an intro to theology.)
I&rsquo;m finally getting close to a &ldquo;final form&rdquo; for my sections of &ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” The course schedule, including reading assignments, is mostly set, but what&rsquo;s really tied together the entire course is the integration of a service learning project throughout the semester.
Throughout the semester, students take what they learn about Franciscan values to design, plan, &amp; implement a service project that does some good for the local community.

        How to teach a course on Francis &amp; Clare of Assisi?1 The 101 class offered by the Department of Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies at St. Bonaventure University is titled “The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” This course aims to introduce students to the Franciscan roots that underlie the mission &amp; values of SBU by a semester-long study of the lives &amp; writings of Francis &amp; Clare.
Teaching such a course is not without its challenges.

        I admire the aim in Elizabeth Johnson&rsquo;s Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&rsquo;s life, death, &amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp; while I don&rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&rsquo;s life (natal &amp; risen) &amp; his death don&rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.
