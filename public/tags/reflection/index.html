        When I started micro blogging in 2021, I never planned to do anything but that: micro blog. I&rsquo;d tried to blog before&mdash;my first website was a static site generated by Jekyll&mdash;but it had never stuck. I liked the idea of instead having a fairly low-effort, ephemeral site: a blog populated with posts about what I&rsquo;m reading, quotations I&rsquo;m mulling over, even some pictures, etc. For a while that&rsquo;s all I did with micro.

        (Well, not quite Theology 101; rather, Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies 101, which isn&rsquo;t exactly an intro to theology.)
I&rsquo;m finally getting close to a &ldquo;final form&rdquo; for my sections of &ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” The course schedule, including reading assignments, is mostly set, but what&rsquo;s really tied together the entire course is the integration of a service learning project throughout the semester.
Throughout the semester, students take what they learn about Franciscan values to design, plan, &amp; implement a service project that does some good for the local community.

        How to teach a course on Francis &amp; Clare of Assisi?1 The 101 class offered by the Department of Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies at St. Bonaventure University is titled “The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” This course aims to introduce students to the Franciscan roots that underlie the mission &amp; values of SBU by a semester-long study of the lives &amp; writings of Francis &amp; Clare.
Teaching such a course is not without its challenges.

        Inspired by Phil Christman&rsquo;s recent post of the same name, here&rsquo;s a list of a few things you would read if you wanted to figure out what I get out of Christianity.
Here&rsquo;s Christman&rsquo;s own disclaimer regarding his list, which I also make for my own:
 This is not, by the way, a canon or an attempt at canon-making. It’s extremely personal, and reflects my personal circumstances, which are narrow, like everyone’s.

        This year I read 63 books (actually a couple more, as there were some I didn&rsquo;t log), &amp; I tracked my reading with StoryGraph. This graph is so interesting; you can see the effect the fall &amp; spring semesters have on my reading.
Some of the more engaging books I read this year include:
 Transforming Fire: Imagining Christian Teaching. Mark D. Jordan. The Argonauts. Maggie Nelson. How to Be Normal.

        Yesterday I saw a tweet floating around asking for your &ldquo;personal canon,&rdquo; that is, which are the books that you have used to understand the world? Limiting myself only to written works (and not, say, music or film), here&rsquo;s what I would say, roughly ordered according to when I encountered these books:
 The gospel according to Luke The book of Revelation A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens Les Misérables by Victor Hugo Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander by Thomas Merton Proslogion by Anselm of Canterbury The Plague by Albert Camus The Prophets by Abraham J.
