      <description>Fiducia supplicans presents itself as &amp;ldquo;an innovative contribution to the pastoral meaning of blessings, permitting a broadening &amp;amp; enrichment of the classical understanding of blessings&amp;rdquo; (emphasis original). I have already said something about how this &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo; might fit into a Catholic theological project, particularly where doctrinal development is concerned. I&amp;rsquo;d like now to comment more broadly on the document itself &amp;amp; what it has to say about blessings of couples. My main takeaway from Fiducia supplicans is that all persons &amp;amp; couples, including but not only those couples whose relationships do not conform to the church&amp;rsquo;s expectations, stand in need of God&amp;rsquo;s love &amp;amp; mercy, &amp;amp; so spontaneous, frequent, &amp;amp; abundant blessing of all persons &amp;amp; couples ought to be a regular feature of the church&amp;rsquo;s life as &amp;ldquo;sacrament of God&amp;rsquo;s infinite love&amp;rdquo; (§43).</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;What do you keep on arguing for? I&amp;rsquo;m only telling you the sort of chap I am. I only want my rights. I&amp;rsquo;m not asking for anybody&amp;rsquo;s bleeding charity.&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;Then do. At once. Ask for the Bleeding Charity. Everything is here for the asking &amp;amp; nothing can be bought.&amp;rsquo;
 This is one of my favorite exchanges in C. S. Lewis&amp;rsquo;s The Great Divorce. Here the &amp;ldquo;Big Man&amp;rdquo; (the first speaker) is insisting on his own decency in his earthly life&amp;mdash;ironic considering the reader is introduced to the Big Man when he beats a man up to take his place in the line for the bus to Heaven&amp;mdash;&amp;amp; how Heaven is therefore his &amp;ldquo;by rights.</description>

      <description>Walter Kasper on kingdom of God:
 But when the ultimate source of all reality, God&amp;rsquo;s love, re-establishes itself and comes to power, the world is restored to order and salvation. Because each individual can feel himself accepted and approved without reserve, he becomes free to live with others. The coming of the Kingdom of God&amp;rsquo;s love therefore means the salvation of the world as a whole and the salvation of every individual.</description>

      <description>In the very year of our engagement, Lady Bird was released.
Toward the end of this magnanimous film
the titular character meets with her English teacher, Sister Sarah Joan,
to discuss a short story she wrote for class.
That wise nun comments how clearly
Lady Bird’s love for Sacramento comes through,
much to Lady Bird’s—and the viewer’s—surprise.
Up till now we have seen Lady Bird straining
at the borders of her hometown</description>
