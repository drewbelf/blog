      <description>I really enjoyed both Barbie &amp;amp; Oppenheimer; I plan to see both again soon, but some initial thoughts:
Barbie is just so fun to watch, start to finish. The production design is stunningly detailed, the writing is weird &amp;amp; funny, &amp;amp; Ryan Gosling &amp;amp; Margot Robbie both deliver wonderful performances&amp;mdash;Gosling&amp;rsquo;s wonderfully funny, &amp;amp; Robbie&amp;rsquo;s wonderfully subtle. Greta Gerwig adds another film to her already impressive body of work in this sensitive &amp;amp; delightful reflection on the human project of making meaning in the face of uncertainty &amp;amp; death.</description>

      <description>I admire the aim in Elizabeth Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&amp;rsquo;s life, death, &amp;amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp;amp; while I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&amp;rsquo;s life (natal &amp;amp; risen) &amp;amp; his death don&amp;rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&amp;rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;What do you keep on arguing for? I&amp;rsquo;m only telling you the sort of chap I am. I only want my rights. I&amp;rsquo;m not asking for anybody&amp;rsquo;s bleeding charity.&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;Then do. At once. Ask for the Bleeding Charity. Everything is here for the asking &amp;amp; nothing can be bought.&amp;rsquo;
 This is one of my favorite exchanges in C. S. Lewis&amp;rsquo;s The Great Divorce. Here the &amp;ldquo;Big Man&amp;rdquo; (the first speaker) is insisting on his own decency in his earthly life&amp;mdash;ironic considering the reader is introduced to the Big Man when he beats a man up to take his place in the line for the bus to Heaven&amp;mdash;&amp;amp; how Heaven is therefore his &amp;ldquo;by rights.</description>
