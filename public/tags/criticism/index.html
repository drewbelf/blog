        In 1943, Pope Pius XII promulgated Divino afflante Spiritu, encouraging the translation of the Bible on the basis of original Hebrew &amp; Greek texts. Prior to Divino afflante Spiritu the Latin Vulgate had served as the textual basis for Catholic translations of the Bible; this new directive from the pope inaugurated the modern era of Catholic biblical scholarship.
The French Dominicans at the École Biblique in Jerusalem answered the call, publishing a French translation of the Bible&mdash;La Bible de Jérusalem&mdash;in 1956.

        In the eighth episode of Beef, in one of a series of flashbacks filling in the backstories of the two beefing protagonists (or, better, the two antagonists), we see a particularly affecting scene between Danny &amp; his younger brother, Paul that illustrates what Thomas Merton calls &ldquo;the pattern &amp; prototype of all sin.&rdquo; (Spoilers follow.)
Danny &amp; Paul are at their parents’ motel: Danny is perhaps 20 or 21 years old &amp; working as his parents’ handyman (contractor, he insists), while Paul, three years his junior, is preparing his college applications.

        I really enjoyed both Barbie &amp; Oppenheimer; I plan to see both again soon, but some initial thoughts:
Barbie is just so fun to watch, start to finish. The production design is stunningly detailed, the writing is weird &amp; funny, &amp; Ryan Gosling &amp; Margot Robbie both deliver wonderful performances&mdash;Gosling&rsquo;s wonderfully funny, &amp; Robbie&rsquo;s wonderfully subtle. Greta Gerwig adds another film to her already impressive body of work in this sensitive &amp; delightful reflection on the human project of making meaning in the face of uncertainty &amp; death.

        I admire the aim in Elizabeth Johnson&rsquo;s Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&rsquo;s life, death, &amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp; while I don&rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&rsquo;s life (natal &amp; risen) &amp; his death don&rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.

        &lsquo;What do you keep on arguing for? I&rsquo;m only telling you the sort of chap I am. I only want my rights. I&rsquo;m not asking for anybody&rsquo;s bleeding charity.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then do. At once. Ask for the Bleeding Charity. Everything is here for the asking &amp; nothing can be bought.&rsquo;
This is one of my favorite exchanges in C. S. Lewis&rsquo;s The Great Divorce. Here the &ldquo;Big Man&rdquo; (the first speaker) is insisting on his own decency in his earthly life&mdash;ironic considering the reader is introduced to the Big Man when he beats a man up to take his place in the line for the bus to Heaven&mdash;&amp; how Heaven is therefore his &ldquo;by rights.
