      <description>Clarkson University announces plan to phase out majors in humanities, communications.&#xA;[Kelly] Chezum [Clarkson&amp;rsquo;s vice president for external relations] said the university has always been focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The nine majors being phased out — social documentation, history, literature, sociology, film, political science, digital arts and sciences, communications and media, and interdisciplinary liberal studies and humanities — represent less than 2% of students.&#xA;Very often when programs in the humanities are cut, the cuts are justified&amp;mdash;explicitly or not&amp;mdash;by pointing out how few students will be affected by these cuts.</description>
