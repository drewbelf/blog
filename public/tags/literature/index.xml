What an amazing film. I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to say much about it here, because I know I can&amp;rsquo;t do it justice in the space of a short paragraph.</description>

      <description>I thought it might be fun at the end of each month to list the movies I&amp;rsquo;d seen that month &amp;amp; some thoughts about each.&#xA;Rope (Alfred Hitchcock, 1948). Jacqueline &amp;amp; I decided to watch some Hitchcock in honor of Halloween at the end of the month. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few Hitchcock already, but not Rope. I enjoyed it, though it&amp;rsquo;s not my favorite of his (that remains Psycho). I love good, long scenes, &amp;amp; Hitchcock&amp;rsquo;s clever camera work to make the entire film seem like a single take really ratchets up the tension.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Phil Christman&amp;rsquo;s recent post of the same name, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of a few things you would read if you wanted to figure out what I get out of Christianity.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s Christman&amp;rsquo;s own disclaimer regarding his list, which I also make for my own:&#xA;This is not, by the way, a canon or an attempt at canon-making. It’s extremely personal, and reflects my personal circumstances, which are narrow, like everyone’s.</description>

      <description>This year I read 63 books (actually a couple more, as there were some I didn&amp;rsquo;t log), &amp;amp; I tracked my reading with StoryGraph. This graph is so interesting; you can see the effect the fall &amp;amp; spring semesters have on my reading.&#xA;Some of the more engaging books I read this year include:&#xA;Transforming Fire: Imagining Christian Teaching. Mark D. Jordan. The Argonauts. Maggie Nelson. How to Be Normal. Phil Christman.</description>

      <title>A personal canon (in progress)</title>

      <description>Yesterday I saw a tweet floating around asking for your &amp;ldquo;personal canon,&amp;rdquo; that is, which are the books that you have used to understand the world? Limiting myself only to written works (and not, say, music or film), here&amp;rsquo;s what I would say, roughly ordered according to when I encountered these books:&#xA;The gospel according to Luke The book of Revelation A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens Les Misérables by Victor Hugo Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander by Thomas Merton Proslogion by Anselm of Canterbury The Plague by Albert Camus The Prophets by Abraham J.</description>
