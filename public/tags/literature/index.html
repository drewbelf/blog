        &lsquo;What do you keep on arguing for? I&rsquo;m only telling you the sort of chap I am. I only want my rights. I&rsquo;m not asking for anybody&rsquo;s bleeding charity.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then do. At once. Ask for the Bleeding Charity. Everything is here for the asking &amp; nothing can be bought.&rsquo;
 This is one of my favorite exchanges in C. S. Lewis&rsquo;s The Great Divorce. Here the &ldquo;Big Man&rdquo; (the first speaker) is insisting on his own decency in his earthly life&mdash;ironic considering the reader is introduced to the Big Man when he beats a man up to take his place in the line for the bus to Heaven&mdash;&amp; how Heaven is therefore his &ldquo;by rights.

        Inspired by Phil Christman&rsquo;s recent post of the same name, here&rsquo;s a list of a few things you would read if you wanted to figure out what I get out of Christianity.
Here&rsquo;s Christman&rsquo;s own disclaimer regarding his list, which I also make for my own:
 This is not, by the way, a canon or an attempt at canon-making. It’s extremely personal, and reflects my personal circumstances, which are narrow, like everyone’s.

        Yesterday I saw a tweet floating around asking for your &ldquo;personal canon,&rdquo; that is, which are the books that you have used to understand the world? Limiting myself only to written works (and not, say, music or film), here&rsquo;s what I would say, roughly ordered according to when I encountered these books:
 The gospel according to Luke The book of Revelation A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens Les Misérables by Victor Hugo Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander by Thomas Merton Proslogion by Anselm of Canterbury The Plague by Albert Camus The Prophets by Abraham J.
