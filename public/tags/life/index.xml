      <description>This year I read 63 books (actually a couple more, as there were some I didn&amp;rsquo;t log), &amp;amp; I tracked my reading with StoryGraph. This graph is so interesting; you can see the effect the fall &amp;amp; spring semesters have on my reading.
Some of the more engaging books I read this year include:
 Transforming Fire: Imagining Christian Teaching. Mark D. Jordan. The Argonauts. Maggie Nelson. How to Be Normal.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I saw a tweet floating around asking for your &amp;ldquo;personal canon,&amp;rdquo; that is, which are the books that you have used to understand the world? Limiting myself only to written works (and not, say, music or film), here&amp;rsquo;s what I would say, roughly ordered according to when I encountered these books:
 The gospel according to Luke The book of Revelation A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens Les Misérables by Victor Hugo Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander by Thomas Merton Proslogion by Anselm of Canterbury The Plague by Albert Camus The Prophets by Abraham J.</description>

      <description>In the very year of our engagement, Lady Bird was released.
Toward the end of this magnanimous film
the titular character meets with her English teacher, Sister Sarah Joan,
to discuss a short story she wrote for class.
That wise nun comments how clearly
Lady Bird’s love for Sacramento comes through,
much to Lady Bird’s—and the viewer’s—surprise.
Up till now we have seen Lady Bird straining
at the borders of her hometown</description>
