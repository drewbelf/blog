        Here I rank the Oscars nominees for Best Picture, from least favorite to favorite. Honestly this was a very good year for Best Picture nominees so it was hard ranking them. With the exception of my bottom 3 (I really did not care for any of those), I could very easily arrive at an entirely different ranking, depending on the day.
10. Maestro Everything about Bradley Cooper&rsquo;s Leonard Bernstein biopic just felt so effortful, especially the performances.

        Fiducia supplicans presents itself as &ldquo;an innovative contribution to the pastoral meaning of blessings, permitting a broadening &amp; enrichment of the classical understanding of blessings&rdquo; (emphasis original). I have already said something about how this &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; might fit into a Catholic theological project, particularly where doctrinal development is concerned. I&rsquo;d like now to comment more broadly on the document itself &amp; what it has to say about blessings of couples. My main takeaway from Fiducia supplicans is that all persons &amp; couples, including but not only those couples whose relationships do not conform to the church&rsquo;s expectations, stand in need of God&rsquo;s love &amp; mercy, &amp; so spontaneous, frequent, &amp; abundant blessing of all persons &amp; couples ought to be a regular feature of the church&rsquo;s life as &ldquo;sacrament of God&rsquo;s infinite love&rdquo; (§43).

        Clarkson University announces plan to phase out majors in humanities, communications.
[Kelly] Chezum [Clarkson&rsquo;s vice president for external relations] said the university has always been focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The nine majors being phased out — social documentation, history, literature, sociology, film, political science, digital arts and sciences, communications and media, and interdisciplinary liberal studies and humanities — represent less than 2% of students.
Very often when programs in the humanities are cut, the cuts are justified&mdash;explicitly or not&mdash;by pointing out how few students will be affected by these cuts.
