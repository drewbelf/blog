      <description>In which I watched Killers of the Flower Moon, The Blair Witch Project, &amp;amp; The Killing of a Sacred Deer; &amp;amp; read Questioning God, Ways of Seeing, Revelations of Divine Love, &amp;amp; Julian of Norwich, Theologian.
Killers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023). What an amazing film. I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to say much about it here, because I know I can&amp;rsquo;t do it justice in the space of a short paragraph.</description>

      <description>I thought it might be fun at the end of each month to list the movies I&amp;rsquo;d seen that month &amp;amp; some thoughts about each.
Rope (Alfred Hitchcock, 1948). Jacqueline &amp;amp; I decided to watch some Hitchcock in honor of Halloween at the end of the month. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few Hitchcock already, but not Rope. I enjoyed it, though it&amp;rsquo;s not my favorite of his (that remains Psycho). I love good, long scenes, &amp;amp; Hitchcock&amp;rsquo;s clever camera work to make the entire film seem like a single take really ratchets up the tension.</description>

      <description>I really enjoyed both Barbie &amp;amp; Oppenheimer; I plan to see both again soon, but some initial thoughts:
Barbie is just so fun to watch, start to finish. The production design is stunningly detailed, the writing is weird &amp;amp; funny, &amp;amp; Ryan Gosling &amp;amp; Margot Robbie both deliver wonderful performances&amp;mdash;Gosling&amp;rsquo;s wonderfully funny, &amp;amp; Robbie&amp;rsquo;s wonderfully subtle. Greta Gerwig adds another film to her already impressive body of work in this sensitive &amp;amp; delightful reflection on the human project of making meaning in the face of uncertainty &amp;amp; death.</description>
