            <p>In which I watched <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, &amp; <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em>; &amp; read <em>Questioning God</em>, <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, <em>Revelations of Divine Love</em>, &amp; <em>Julian of Norwich, Theologian</em>.</p>
<p><em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> (Martin Scorsese, 2023). What an amazing film. I don&rsquo;t even want to say much about it here, because I know I can&rsquo;t do it justice in the space of a short paragraph. Each performance&mdash;especially Lily Gladstone&rsquo;s &amp; Leonardo DiCaprio&rsquo;s&mdash;is exactly what it should be. If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, go see it.</p>
<p><em>The Blair Witch Project</em> (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, 1999). I remember <em>Paranormal Activity</em> being huge when I was in high school; I was at the time too scared of scary movies, but I remember being intrigued by the &ldquo;found footage&rdquo; conceit. (I guess that style of horror was a little overdone, even by 2007.) <em>Blair Witch Project</em> is the film that mainstreamed found footage. What an incredible film! I thought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_lqGnLtWA" target="_blank">Heather Donahue</a> was so good, &amp; the night scenes were so spooky &amp; effective. &amp; that last shot! Learning more about its production from <a href="https://www.unspooledpodcast.com/" target="_blank">the Unspooled podcast</a> really deepened my appreciation for it, too.</p>
<p><em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em> (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2017). I decided to watch this more or less at random one night while Jacqueline was out of town&mdash;Netflix recommended it to me, &amp; it seemed like a film that I would enjoy and Jac would not. I was certainly right about that. It made me want to see more of Lanthimos&rsquo;s work (&amp; as it happens I was already looking forward to his <em>Poor Things</em>, even before watching this film).</p>
<p><em>Questioning God</em> (Timothy Radcliffe &amp; Łukasz Popko, 2023). One of my professors in undergrad said Timothy Radcliffe &amp; I had a &ldquo;similar style,&rdquo; &amp; ever since then I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out what he means. (I took it, and still take it, as a compliment, though I&rsquo;m still not quite sure what my professor saw in me.) I found this book a little disappointing. It&rsquo;s written as a dialogue between the coauthors, but I&rsquo;m not sure that format was particularly effective. My favorite part of the book was the epilogue, which was not formatted as a dialogue (&amp; so, I assume, was more properly &ldquo;cowritten&rdquo;). I understand why they wrote the book as a dialogue&mdash;the book is about dialogue between God &amp; humans&mdash;but it didn&rsquo;t totally work for me.</p>
<p><em>Ways of Seeing</em> (John Berger, 1972). Every piece of art has an ideology encoded into it. You&rsquo;ve heard of the male gaze; Berger&rsquo;s analysis of the history of the female nude shows what that means. I have to think that Matt Weiner had the last chapter in mind when he created <em>Mad Men</em>: <a href="https://youtu.be/fjg5TuXV09U?si=-BRxfq7KSGTohyOT" target="_blank">“What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons.”</a></p>
<p><em>Revelations of Divine Love</em> (Julian of Norwich, ca. late 14th century). I&rsquo;ve read Julian&rsquo;s <em>Shewings</em> a number of times before, but this time I was reading it for a chapter I&rsquo;m writing. I was especially struck at Julian&rsquo;s insistence on the goodness &amp; mercy of God, which makes for a fruitful contrast with her sustained reflections on suffering &amp; Christ&rsquo;s passion.</p>
<p><em>Julian of Norwich, Theologian</em> (Denys Turner, 2011). Wow, what a work. Turner&rsquo;s account of Julian&rsquo;s &ldquo;two stories”&mdash;the story sin tells about itself, &amp; the story that God tells about sin&mdash;is so illuminating. This book makes me want to design my entire Catholic Theology course around Julian&rsquo;s <em>Shewings</em>. (I won&rsquo;t because I don&rsquo;t have time &hellip; but maybe someday.)</p>
<p>I also kept a log in <a href="/posts/20231031_logbook/">October 2023</a>.</p>
