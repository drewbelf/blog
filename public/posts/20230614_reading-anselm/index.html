            <p>I admire the aim in Elizabeth Johnson&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781626982666" target="_blank">Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril</a></em>: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&rsquo;s life, death, &amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp; while I don&rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&rsquo;s life (natal &amp; risen) &amp; his death don&rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.</p>
<p>More frustrating is the hostility toward Anselm of Canterbury &amp; his satisfaction theory. It seems to me Johnson could have attended more carefully to Anselm&rsquo;s method (<em>remoto Christi</em> does not necessarily mean <em>remoto fidei</em>) &amp; the scope of <em>Cur Deus homo</em>; I also think her treatment of satisfaction theory actually reads later theories (especially penal substitutionary atonement) back into Anselm. I&rsquo;m not sure what accounts for this superficial reading; perhaps engaging more up-to-date scholarship could have helped better situate Anselm in his proper context (more Benedictine monastic than feudal).</p>
<p>The treatment of Anselm is disappointing not only because it misrepresents him, but also because I actually think Anselm could be a resource for Johnson&rsquo;s project here. His concerns are not identical to hers, of course&mdash;we wouldn&rsquo;t expect them to be&mdash;but the themes of mercy and cosmic setting-aright are decisive for Anselm. I think a more generous and productive reading of Anselm is possible.</p>
