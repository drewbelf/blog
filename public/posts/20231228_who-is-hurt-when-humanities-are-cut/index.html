<blockquote>
<p>[Kelly] Chezum [Clarkson&rsquo;s vice president for external relations] said the university has always been focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The nine majors being phased out ‚Äî social documentation, history, literature, sociology, film, political science, digital arts and sciences, communications and media, and interdisciplinary liberal studies and humanities ‚Äî represent less than 2% of students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very often when programs in the humanities are cut, the cuts are justified&mdash;explicitly or not&mdash;by pointing how few students will be affected by these cuts. The &ldquo;vice president for external relations&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> here points out that Clarkson has historically been more of a STEM school anyway &amp; that only a very small percentage of students are members of the programs being cut. The suggestion, then, is that Clarkson students aren&rsquo;t really getting hurt in all this&mdash;there are hardly any students choosing these majors in the first place, &amp; prospective students who are interested in those majors (a very small share of prospective students, presumably) can simply look elsewhere.</p>
<p>But are those students&mdash;students enrolled in the cut programs&mdash;the only students affected? I&rsquo;m not so sure. It seems to me that the university&rsquo;s aspiration of universal truth (note the shared root in &ldquo;university&rdquo; and &ldquo;universal&rdquo;) is at least partially satisfied by having a diversity of persons in the classroom. Diversity here would include, among other things, a variety of fields, disciplines, &amp; studies represented among the faculty &amp; the student body. I have to think the classroom experience will suffer without any literature, history, or philosophy students in the room. The university has not yet said anything about its plans for the general education curriculum, but at present it looks like that curriculum is the only opportunity Clarkson students will have to ask fundamental questions of human existence &amp; meaning. Neither will Clarkson students have classmates whose course of study is oriented to such questions. That seems to me like a real loss for Clarkson students.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to beat up on Clarkson&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a fine STEM school&mdash;but this sort of rhetoric is fairly common when programs in the humanities are cut: students aren&rsquo;t majoring in it anyway, so why do we need it? Well, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/02/opinion/humanities-liberal-arts-policy-higher-education.html" target="_blank">maybe the humanities serve a purpose for the university beyond just another degree program</a>.</p>
