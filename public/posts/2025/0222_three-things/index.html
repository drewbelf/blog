<p>Well, this is my first Three Things since October 2024. So much for a <a href="/posts/2024/0928_three-things">more sustainable format for regular blogging</a>! Last October things really did pick up for me at work: I presented at the <a href="https://www1.villanova.edu/university/liberal-arts-sciences/programs/theology/events/pmr.html" target="_blank">Patristic, Medieval, &amp; Renaissance Studies conference</a> in November so I was spending the last couple months rushing to finish up my paper. &amp; the back half of the semester always seems like it&rsquo;s nonstop, especially when I&rsquo;m teaching new classes as I was in the fall. (Well, I&rsquo;ve taught The Way of Francis &amp; Clare before, but I was teaching an almost entirely new version of it.) It&rsquo;s not hard, I&rsquo;ve found, for teaching &amp; research &amp; service to consume almost everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So to avoid being consumed, I&rsquo;m trying, as a rule this semester, not to work on the weekends. I just want to have a life outside of teaching &amp; research. This spring semester I&rsquo;m teaching two courses I&rsquo;ve taught before&mdash;The Way of Francis &amp; Clare, &amp; Catholic Theology&mdash;&amp; I&rsquo;ve made no major changes to either since the last time I taught them, which helps me keep this rule. Many of my lessons are already planned &amp; so I can use the time I would have used lesson planning to keep up with grading, research, &amp; my service responsibilities. I&rsquo;m still sometimes tempted to &ldquo;get ahead&rdquo; on things for next week over the weekend. But I&rsquo;ve come to think that many of my tasks will take as long as I give them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, I say that as I&rsquo;m currently taking a break/procrastinating from the grading I&rsquo;m doing today. I have a good excuse: I want to return these papers to students on Tuesday as I&rsquo;m anticipating a lot of absences on Thursday (the last Tuesday/Thursday class before midterm break), &amp; I know I can&rsquo;t leave all of the remaining papers to Monday.</p>
</li>
</ol>
