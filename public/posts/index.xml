      <description>When I started micro blogging in 2021, I never planned to do anything but that: micro blog. I&amp;rsquo;d tried to blog before&amp;mdash;my first website was a static site generated by Jekyll&amp;mdash;but it had never stuck. I liked the idea of instead having a fairly low-effort, ephemeral site: a blog populated with posts about what I&amp;rsquo;m reading, quotations I&amp;rsquo;m mulling over, even some pictures, etc. For a while that&amp;rsquo;s all I did with micro.</description>

      <title>Fiducia supplicans &amp; church teaching</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a fair amount of hand wringing over Fiducia supplicans where the consistency of church teaching &amp;amp; papal authority are concerned. The concern goes something like this: Pope Francis, while reaffirming the Catholic church&amp;rsquo;s historical teaching on marriage (as possible only between a woman &amp;amp; a man), has allowed for the blessing of a same-sex couple (but not their relationship). This means the Catholic church will have to either forge ahead, perhaps revising its understanding of marriage to include same-sex unions, or pull back from Fiducia supplicans to reaffirm its historical understanding of marriage.</description>

      <description>It was winter in Italy, eight hundred years ago, &amp;amp; Assisi’s poverello had an idea.1 Francis of Assisi had become obsessed with the words &amp;amp; deeds of Jesus Christ, his rustic parables &amp;amp; simple gestures that, despite (or perhaps because of) their lowliness, communicated divine majesty &amp;amp; awe. According to an early biographer,2 “so thoroughly did the humility of the incarnation &amp;amp; the charity of the passion occupy his memory that he scarcely wanted to think of anything else.</description>

      <description>In which I watched Killers of the Flower Moon, The Blair Witch Project, &amp;amp; The Killing of a Sacred Deer; &amp;amp; read Questioning God, Ways of Seeing, Revelations of Divine Love, &amp;amp; Julian of Norwich, Theologian.
Killers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023). What an amazing film. I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to say much about it here, because I know I can&amp;rsquo;t do it justice in the space of a short paragraph.</description>

      <description>I thought it might be fun at the end of each month to list the movies I&amp;rsquo;d seen that month &amp;amp; some thoughts about each.
Rope (Alfred Hitchcock, 1948). Jacqueline &amp;amp; I decided to watch some Hitchcock in honor of Halloween at the end of the month. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few Hitchcock already, but not Rope. I enjoyed it, though it&amp;rsquo;s not my favorite of his (that remains Psycho). I love good, long scenes, &amp;amp; Hitchcock&amp;rsquo;s clever camera work to make the entire film seem like a single take really ratchets up the tension.</description>

      <title>Writing assignments in Theology 101</title>

      <description>(Well, not quite Theology 101; rather, Theology &amp;amp; Franciscan Studies 101, which isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly an intro to theology.)
I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting close to a &amp;ldquo;final form&amp;rdquo; for my sections of &amp;ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp;amp; Clare.” The course schedule, including reading assignments, is mostly set, but what&amp;rsquo;s really tied together the entire course is the integration of a service learning project throughout the semester.
Throughout the semester, students take what they learn about Franciscan values to design, plan, &amp;amp; implement a service project that does some good for the local community.</description>

      <description>I really enjoyed both Barbie &amp;amp; Oppenheimer; I plan to see both again soon, but some initial thoughts:
Barbie is just so fun to watch, start to finish. The production design is stunningly detailed, the writing is weird &amp;amp; funny, &amp;amp; Ryan Gosling &amp;amp; Margot Robbie both deliver wonderful performances&amp;mdash;Gosling&amp;rsquo;s wonderfully funny, &amp;amp; Robbie&amp;rsquo;s wonderfully subtle. Greta Gerwig adds another film to her already impressive body of work in this sensitive &amp;amp; delightful reflection on the human project of making meaning in the face of uncertainty &amp;amp; death.</description>

      <description>How to teach a course on Francis &amp;amp; Clare of Assisi?1 The 101 class offered by the Department of Theology &amp;amp; Franciscan Studies at St. Bonaventure University is titled “The Way of Francis &amp;amp; Clare.” This course aims to introduce students to the Franciscan roots that underlie the mission &amp;amp; values of SBU by a semester-long study of the lives &amp;amp; writings of Francis &amp;amp; Clare.
Teaching such a course is not without its challenges.</description>

      <description>I admire the aim in Elizabeth Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&amp;rsquo;s life, death, &amp;amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp;amp; while I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&amp;rsquo;s life (natal &amp;amp; risen) &amp;amp; his death don&amp;rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&amp;rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;What do you keep on arguing for? I&amp;rsquo;m only telling you the sort of chap I am. I only want my rights. I&amp;rsquo;m not asking for anybody&amp;rsquo;s bleeding charity.&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;Then do. At once. Ask for the Bleeding Charity. Everything is here for the asking &amp;amp; nothing can be bought.&amp;rsquo;
 This is one of my favorite exchanges in C. S. Lewis&amp;rsquo;s The Great Divorce. Here the &amp;ldquo;Big Man&amp;rdquo; (the first speaker) is insisting on his own decency in his earthly life&amp;mdash;ironic considering the reader is introduced to the Big Man when he beats a man up to take his place in the line for the bus to Heaven&amp;mdash;&amp;amp; how Heaven is therefore his &amp;ldquo;by rights.</description>

      <description>Walter Kasper on kingdom of God:
 But when the ultimate source of all reality, God&amp;rsquo;s love, re-establishes itself and comes to power, the world is restored to order and salvation. Because each individual can feel himself accepted and approved without reserve, he becomes free to live with others. The coming of the Kingdom of God&amp;rsquo;s love therefore means the salvation of the world as a whole and the salvation of every individual.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Phil Christman&amp;rsquo;s recent post of the same name, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of a few things you would read if you wanted to figure out what I get out of Christianity.
Here&amp;rsquo;s Christman&amp;rsquo;s own disclaimer regarding his list, which I also make for my own:
 This is not, by the way, a canon or an attempt at canon-making. It’s extremely personal, and reflects my personal circumstances, which are narrow, like everyone’s.</description>

      <description>This year I read 63 books (actually a couple more, as there were some I didn&amp;rsquo;t log), &amp;amp; I tracked my reading with StoryGraph. This graph is so interesting; you can see the effect the fall &amp;amp; spring semesters have on my reading.
Some of the more engaging books I read this year include:
 Transforming Fire: Imagining Christian Teaching. Mark D. Jordan. The Argonauts. Maggie Nelson. How to Be Normal.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I saw a tweet floating around asking for your &amp;ldquo;personal canon,&amp;rdquo; that is, which are the books that you have used to understand the world? Limiting myself only to written works (and not, say, music or film), here&amp;rsquo;s what I would say, roughly ordered according to when I encountered these books:
 The gospel according to Luke The book of Revelation A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens Les Misérables by Victor Hugo Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander by Thomas Merton Proslogion by Anselm of Canterbury The Plague by Albert Camus The Prophets by Abraham J.</description>

      <description>Holy Week of any year&amp;mdash;that week of prayer &amp;amp; fasting ordered to the cross and, eventually, the empty tomb—always has a nearness to the first Holy Week, as the drama of the liturgy moves modern-day Christians through the drama of the passion. Holy Week 2020, however, seemed especially near. The reality of coronavirus was setting in, along with the bitter realization it would be a long time before we could safely gather with family, friends, &amp;amp; religious communities.</description>

      <description>Good &amp;amp; gracious God,
you who are power &amp;amp; wisdom &amp;amp; goodness—
Bless this tree,
a sign of life &amp;amp; freshness &amp;amp; perseverance in our midst.
May it stand as a reminder
of light in the dark of night,
and of life in the dead of winter.
May its supple branches &amp;amp; sharp, sweet scent
keep fresh in our minds &amp;amp; our hands
the mercy &amp;amp; generosity you show
in all your dealings with your beloved people.</description>

      <description>Dear C—,1
This past Sunday, on a cool &amp;amp; bright New York day with the edges of autumn just beginning to creep into the last days of summer, you were baptized. Like autumn into summer, you may find the fact of your baptism—something in which you had no say &amp;amp; of which you have no memory—creeping into your life in strange &amp;amp; unexpected ways; you may not know quite why you were baptized; you may wonder what the point of your baptism was at all.</description>

      <description>In the very year of our engagement, Lady Bird was released.
Toward the end of this magnanimous film
the titular character meets with her English teacher, Sister Sarah Joan,
to discuss a short story she wrote for class.
That wise nun comments how clearly
Lady Bird’s love for Sacramento comes through,
much to Lady Bird’s—and the viewer’s—surprise.
Up till now we have seen Lady Bird straining
at the borders of her hometown</description>
