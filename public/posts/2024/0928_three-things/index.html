<p>I&rsquo;ve been very inconsistent <strong>writing for this blog</strong>. I tried to put a bit more regularity into things with the <a href="/tags/logbook">logbook</a> format, but that became too much to keep up with, especially while the semester is in progress. So I&rsquo;m going to try this <a href="/tags/three-things">three things</a> format: on a more-or-less weekly basis I&rsquo;ll share three things that have been on my mind since the last three things post. I think I need some sort of &ldquo;plan&rdquo; if I&rsquo;m going to write here regularly, but writing mini reviews of everything I was reading &amp; watching (even if only a couple sentences each) was just way too much.</p>

<p>Over the past couple weeks I&rsquo;ve been refreshing my <strong>RSS feeds</strong>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social" target="_blank">When Google Reader was discontinued</a> (RIP) I made the switch to <a href="https://feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a>, &amp; then sometime more recently I switched to <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/" target="_blank">Inoreader</a>. (I don&rsquo;t remember why.) Inoreader never quite clicked with me, &amp; so I wasn&rsquo;t really reading my RSS feeds all that consistently. But as part of a larger initiative to get a handle on my digital life (especially my email inbox) I&rsquo;m trying to put as much as I can&mdash;especially email newsletters&mdash;into an RSS reader. I decided to try out Feedbin &amp; I&rsquo;m glad I did. The interface is really clean &amp; pleasant to read, &amp; it has enough features to elevate it above a free reader but not so many features as to overwhelm.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had a <strong>writing lab</strong> assignment in my <a href="/posts/20230623_on-teaching-francis-clare/">The Way of Francis &amp; Clare</a> class. (That reminds me, I need to write an update to how I&rsquo;m approaching my Francis &amp; Clare course.) By the end of the in-class writing lab, each student should have produced an outline for their first writing assignment, which they will write in class on Monday on the basis of their outlines (&amp; only their outlines). Over the course of the writing lab students are encouraged to talk to one another &amp; with me about whatever questions they have, whether relating to course material or the assignment instructions or whatever.
I have several goals in mind with these in-class writing labs, but the main one is I hope students appreciate that writing is a process: there is a planning stage (considering the prompt; conducting research; outlining an approach; integrating various points into a single, coherent treatment; figuring out how these points relate to ideas learned in class &amp; in research; documenting the sources of those ideas so they can be properly cited; etc.) that happens before words are even put to paper. I think this first writing lab was a success: I was able to have conversations with many students (many more than I can take in individual meetings during office hours) clarifying both course material &amp; my expectations for the assignment, &amp; I overheard conversations students were having among themselves about the material. I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading the papers themselves next week.</p>
