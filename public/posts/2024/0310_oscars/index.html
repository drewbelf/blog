            <p>Here I rank the Oscars nominees for Best Picture, from least favorite to favorite. Honestly this was a very good year for Best Picture nominees so it was hard ranking them. With the exception of my bottom 3 (I really did not care for any of those), I could very easily arrive at an entirely different ranking, depending on the day.</p>
<h2 id="10-maestro">10. Maestro</h2>
<p>Everything about Bradley Cooper&rsquo;s Leonard Bernstein biopic just felt so effortful, especially the performances. I have little to say about it because the film was just so uninteresting.</p>
<h2 id="9-the-zone-of-interest">9. The Zone of Interest</h2>
<p>While I appreciated some features of Jonathan Glazer&rsquo;s exploration of the mundane evil of the Holocaust, the film as a whole felt empty. (Maybe that was the idea.)</p>
<h2 id="8-poor-things">8. Poor Things</h2>
<p>I cannot understand the enthusiasm this film garnered. Yorgos Lanthimos&rsquo;s riff on <em>Frankenstein</em>, while delightful to look at &amp; entertaining at times, is so singularly interested in Bella&rsquo;s sexual liberation at the almost utter exclusion of any other aspect of her that the film ends up being tedious &amp; thin. I wanted to like it much more than I did.</p>
<h2 id="7-anatomy-of-a-fall">7. Anatomy of a Fall</h2>
<p>I liked Justine Triet&rsquo;s courtroom drama; it reminded me, at times, of Albert Camus&rsquo;s <em>The Stranger</em>. Especially riveting was the incredibly grim but also totally accurate fight between Sandra &amp; her husband.</p>
<h2 id="6-american-fiction">6. American Fiction</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed Cord Jefferson&rsquo;s satire of the expectations the publishing world (&amp; entertainment culture more broadly) burdens Black artists with. It often felt less like a single story than two different stories spliced together, which unfortunately left the film as a whole a little disjointed. Jeffrey Wright&rsquo;s performance is amazing. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll win Best Actor, but I think he should.</p>
<h2 id="5-the-holdovers">5. The Holdovers</h2>
<p>Alexander Payne&rsquo;s holiday film, about a group of misfits stuck together for the Christmas break, is really fun. I can&rsquo;t remember who said it, but some critic put it well when they said: I&rsquo;ve seen this movie a thousand times before, but this is the best version of this movie. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how the Academy could <em>not</em> award Da&rsquo;Vine Joy Randolph with Best Supporting Actress.</p>
<h2 id="4-oppenheimer">4. Oppenheimer</h2>
<p>While I still stand by <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/posts/20230724_barbenheimer/" target="_blank">my initial feelings</a>&mdash;it buckles a bit under its own weight&mdash;Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s biopic of the architect of the atomic bomb still has thrilling &amp; wrenching moments. The two timelines don&rsquo;t quite hang together &amp; the movie suffers as a result, though the nonlinear approach does allow Nolan to end on the most affecting scene. I think <em>Oppenheimer</em> will win Best Picture (along with most of the awards its received nominations for).</p>
<h2 id="3-past-lives">3. Past Lives</h2>
<p>I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Celine Song&rsquo;s story of lost &amp; rediscovered love. The final few moments are simultaneously heartbreaking &amp; hopeful. Greta Lee is wonderful, as is John Magaro.</p>
<h2 id="2-barbie">2. Barbie</h2>
<p>Greta Gerwig is such an incredible director, finding depths of love &amp; humanity in even the most mundane settings: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNi_HC839Wo" target="_blank">the bickering between a mother &amp; daughter</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AST2-4db4ic" target="_blank">the struggles of &amp; pressures felt by a family of women</a>, &amp; now even the &ldquo;coming-of-age&rdquo; of a plastic doll. Margot Robbie delivers a wonderfully subtle performance, inviting us to consider the ways we make meaning, in ways both helpful &amp; harmful, in the world. I&rsquo;d love to see more collaboration between Gerwig &amp; Robbie (but not, please God, in a <em>Barbie</em> sequel).</p>
<h2 id="1-killers-of-the-flower-moon">1. Killers of the Flower Moon</h2>
<p>Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s crime drama, about prowling wolves devouring the land &amp; its Osage inhabitants, is a brilliant film. Despite the film&rsquo;s length, Scorsese held my interest the entire time, thanks in no small part to the stunning cinematography &amp; excellent performances. Lily Gladstone&rsquo;s deserves to be named Best Actress, &amp; this film deserves Best Picture. The final scene, with Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s cameo, brilliantly reframes the entire film &amp; calls himself&mdash;&amp; the audience&mdash;to account. No one does violence, evil, &amp; calls to repentance like Scorsese.</p>
