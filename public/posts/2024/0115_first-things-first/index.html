            <p>One of the particular challenges of teaching theology today&mdash;even to students who have some religious background&mdash;is the utter lack of theological formation most people in the United States receive. Some students may come in with <em>some</em> religious formation, in that they have participated in their church&rsquo;s faith formation classes or even theology classes in a religious high school, but that formation tends to be more catechetical than theological. To oversimplify, catechesis provides a student with a religious community&rsquo;s answers to theological questions, but it does not always provide the rationale for those answers. <a href="https://andrewbelfield.com/teaching.html" target="_blank">Theology, <em>inter alia</em>, seeks the rationale</a>. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with catechesis&mdash;everyone must begin somewhere&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not theology.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This challenge is compounded by the fact that <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/posts/20230623_on-teaching-francis-clare/" target="_blank">the 101 course I teach is not exactly Theology 101</a>. While teaching &ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp; Clare&rdquo; as an introductory course presents certain opportunities for which I am grateful (&amp; which often benefit students), it also presents certain challenges. In part to face those challenges, I&rsquo;ve designed a &ldquo;first things first&rdquo; unit in which we consider some big questions for the course &amp;, hopefully, given us a shared vocabulary &amp; set of ideas upon which to build.</p>
<p>First, why study theology? <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/study-theology-even-if-you-dont-believe-in-god/280999/" target="_blank">Tara Isabella Burton is our guide here</a>. Her argument for the place of theology in a liberal arts education, published in <em>The Atlantic</em>, is two-pronged. First, the academic discipline of theology represents something like a synthesis &amp; integration of the skills &amp; insights developed across the various fields that together make up the liberal arts&mdash;a &ldquo;Queen of the Humanities,&rdquo; as it were. Second, theology teaches a person to think from the inside out: to get inside the heads of people, past &amp; present, to understand why they do what they do. As I tell students, the goal of theological study is not to convert someone to any particular religion, but rather to convert them to empathy.</p>
<p>Second, what is God? Much of this session is negative, ruling out what God is not. God is not a big man in the sky who grants obedient little humans their wishes. Neither is God, <em>pace</em> Richard Dawkins, a scientific fact about the universe. Here I use (for the first time this semester) <a href="https://www.paulistpress.com/Products/2754-7/what-is-god.aspx" target="_blank">John Haught&rsquo;s <em>What Is God?</em></a>. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Third, what is spirituality? Since &ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp; Clare&rdquo; aims to introduce students to the spiritualities of Francis &amp; Clare, we need to get a handle on what is meant by &ldquo;spirituality&rdquo; in the first place. No one definition for spirituality can satisfy everyone, but I introduce spirituality by way of <a href="https://www.ndbooks.com/book/new-seeds-of-contemplation/" target="_blank">Thomas Merton&rsquo;s <em>New Seeds of Contemplation</em></a>, particularly the chapter &ldquo;Things in Their Identity.&rdquo; Spirituality, in short, is the search for one&rsquo;s &ldquo;true self.&rdquo; Students, <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/10/30/one-of-the.html" target="_blank">I&rsquo;ve found</a>, really like Merton &amp; this chapter.</p>
<p>Fourth, who are Francis &amp; Clare? Few students, I&rsquo;ve found, have heard of Francis&mdash;&amp; if they have, he&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/earthbeat/faith/faith-seeking-understanding/beyond-birdbath-industrial-complex-radical-st-francis" target="_blank">the inoffensive &amp; sweet &ldquo;Francis of the birdbath,&rdquo;</a> not the much more radical figure I want to present&mdash;&amp; none have heard of Clare. I assign a very brief overview of the lives of Francis &amp; Clare, just to give them a quick sense of who these two people are. The hope is to provoke some questions in students that they&rsquo;ll spend the entire semester trying to figure out: what could push these two affluent, privileged people to give up everything &amp; live most of their lives in utter squalor? how do their lives of penance &amp; asceticism connect to their religious conversion? why do lepers figure so prominently in their lives?</p>
<p>Finally, what is service? The semester-long assignment is a service-learning project, which provides students a chance to do some good for their local communities while reflecting on that experience in connection with themes from Franciscan theology &amp; spirituality. To do so fruitfully, they have to understand what it really means to serve, especially in the Franciscan tradition. On this, we consider <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/young-voices/its-time-theology-encounter" target="_blank">Pope Francis&rsquo;s theology of encounter</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html" target="_blank">his interpretation of the parable of the good Samaritan</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of this first unit, I hope to have corrected some theological misapprehensions &amp; perhaps even assuaged some misgivings about the course.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Even though I often wish students came into class with a more refined theological formation, this unit sometimes ends up delivering some of the most engaging class sessions of the course.</p>

<p>What is wrong, it seems to me, is when catechesis is confused for theology. Historically, perhaps, catechesis was more properly theological&mdash;see, e.g., one of my absolute favorite works of theology, <a href="https://svspress.com/catechetical-discourse/" target="_blank">Gregory of Nyssa&rsquo;s <em>Catechetical Oration</em></a>&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case today, at least where Catholic catechesis is concerned. But that&rsquo;s for a different blog post.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Students often tell me they are relieved to learn that the course will not consist of me preaching at them or attempting to indoctrinate them.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
