        <article class="content">
            <p>In 1943, Pope Pius XII promulgated <em><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_30091943_divino-afflante-spiritu.html" target="_blank">Divino afflante Spiritu</a></em>, encouraging the translation of the Bible on the basis of original Hebrew &amp; Greek texts. Prior to <em>Divino afflante Spiritu</em> the Latin Vulgate had served as the textual basis for Catholic translations of the Bible; this new directive from the pope inaugurated the modern era of Catholic biblical scholarship.</p>
<p>The French Dominicans at the École Biblique in Jerusalem answered the call, publishing a French translation of the Bible&mdash;<em>La Bible de Jérusalem</em>&mdash;in 1956.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> In addition to the text itself, <em>La Bible de Jérusalem</em> offered scholarly introductions to each book &amp; extensive notes to the text. Ten years later an English translation&mdash;the Jerusalem Bible&mdash;appeared. More a translation of the French text of <em>La Bible de Jérusalem</em> than the Hebrew &amp; Greek, the primary contribution of the Jerusalem Bible was to make available French biblical scholarship to an English readership. Still, as the first complete translation of the Bible into modern English, the Jerusalem Bible was received eagerly among English-speaking Catholics (&amp; even some Protestants).</p>
<p>Still, advances in biblical scholarship &amp; a need for a proper translation of the Hebrew &amp; Greek texts called for an update to the Jerusalem Bible. In 1985 the New Jerusalem Bible appeared, translating directly the Hebrew &amp; Greek texts while still taking inspiration from the French edition.</p>
<p>Then, in the early 2000s, the African bishops asked for a more affordable edition of the Jerusalem Bible, which brought to light the need for another update to the New Jerusalem Bible. The fruit of that update is the Revised New Jerusalem Bible, published recently (2019) by <a href="https://www.dltbibles.com/the-rnjb" target="_blank">Darton, Longman &amp; Todd</a> under the direction of Henry Wansbrough. The RNJB was produced according to the following three principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>The text should be translated with an ear more for proclamation aloud than silent reading.</li>
<li>The translation should be produced according to a philosophy of formal equivalence rather than dynamic equivalence.</li>
<li>The translation should reflect the fact that the biblical message is addressed to women &amp; men alike.</li>
</ol>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve not spent much time with it, I&rsquo;ve recently become very interested in the Jerusalem Bible tradition of biblical translations. Considering this translation came about as a response to <em>Divino afflante Spiritu</em> &amp; so originates in a solely Catholic initiative,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> the Jerusalem Bible strikes me as a quintessentially Catholic tradition of translation, produced during a period of renewal in Catholic theology.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> From what I understand (&amp; in my own limited experience reading translations in this tradition) it enjoys a better reputation for its literary quality than, say, the New Revised Standard Version or the New American Bible (Revised Edition). Could the Revised New Jerusalem Bible be the end of my search for a preferred Bible translation?<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I began to look more carefully at the RNJB I bought a year or two ago, &amp; I wondered at how its translation compared to the NJB (whose literary quality &amp; theological richness is celebrated). I especially wondered how the shift from the dynamic equivalence of the NJB (meaning-for-meaning) to the formal equivalence (word-for-word) of the RNJB affected the translation. So I decided to compare some passages.</p>

<p>You can see here the RNJB&rsquo;s &ldquo;reading aloud&rdquo; principle in the way it avoids quotations without first introducing the speaker. Again I like some of the NJB&rsquo;s phrases (&ldquo;from the clutches of the Egyptians&rdquo;), but the use of &ldquo;the LORD&rdquo; for the tetragrammaton is a massive improvement on the part of the RNJB.</p>

<p>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer that I have memorized is, I think, a slightly modernized form of the one appearing in the King James Version (&ldquo;Our Father, who art in heaven &hellip;&rdquo;). That language is so familiar to me, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a little uncomfortable reading this one. But I do kind of like the use of &ldquo;debts&rdquo; here rather than &ldquo;trespasses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some lines I prefer the NJB (&ldquo;he has routed the arrogant of heart&rdquo;) &amp; some I prefer the RNJB (&ldquo;he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant&rdquo;). I wonder what Greek word underlies what the NJB translates as &ldquo;faithful love&rdquo; &amp; what the RNJB translates &ldquo;mercy&rdquo;?</p>

<p>I have to say, I don&rsquo;t particularly like how either version translates the first half of this verse; I prefer the KJV&rsquo;s &ldquo;For God so loved the world &hellip;&rdquo;, but that may be because it&rsquo;s familiar (like the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer above)</p>

<p>Here I think we see more sharply the differences between dynamic &amp; formal equivalence. Compare especially verses 7 &amp; 8. I think the NJB&rsquo;s &ldquo;But he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming as human beings are; &amp; being in every way like a human being, he was humbler yet, even to accepting death, death on a cross&rdquo; reads much more nicely than the RNJB&rsquo;s, but I take it the RNJB is closer to the Greek.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Acknowledging that these comparisons are far from exhaustive, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the shift from dynamic to formal equivalence has had a huge impact on translation choices, with some relatively small exceptions. With those exceptions in mind I have to say that I tend to prefer the NJB&rsquo;s renderings to the RNJB,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> though the inclusive language of the RNJB &amp; the use of &ldquo;the LORD&rdquo; for the tetragrammaton are points in favor of the RNJB.</p>
<p>Is the (R)NJB my new preferred translation? Maybe for now. I&rsquo;d like to do a more extensive comparison of the (R)NJB to other versions, especially the English Standard Version - Catholic Edition &amp; the Knox Version, before making any final determinations. But that&rsquo;s a project for another day.</p>

<p>These details are drawn largely from Henry Wansbrough&rsquo;s Foreword to the <em>Revised New Jerusalem Bible: Study Edition</em> (Image Books, 2019).&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>Many&mdash;perhaps even most&mdash;modern English translations began as Protestant translations, which were then adapted for Catholic use (e.g., the Catholic edition of the Revised Standard Version). Exceptions might include the Confraternity Bible&mdash;which is really an update of the Douay Rheims Bible&mdash;&amp; the New American Bible.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>I have in mind the so-called <em>nouvelle théologie</em> / <em>ressourcement</em> movement. It makes me wonder if any of the theologians of this movement&mdash;Chenu, de Lubac, etc.&mdash;ever commented on <em>La Bible de Jérusalem</em>/Jerusalem Bible.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:4">
<p>Someday I might like to write a fuller post on what I&rsquo;m looking for in an English Bible. I really like the <a href="https://catholicbible.online/knox/OT" target="_blank">Knox version</a>, though it is at times a little too idiosyncratic. Offhand I think my desiderata include: (1) a Catholic Bible; (2) that reads well in English; (3) without being too loose with respect to the Hebrew &amp; Greek; &amp; (4) with language that is not so idiosyncratic as to be unrecognizable to non-Catholic Christians.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:5">
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Greek so I can&rsquo;t check myself, but the RNJB sounds closer to most modern English translations that also proceed according to formal equivalence.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:6">
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s a place for dynamic equivalence translations, especially in private devotional reading, so long as it does not become too unmoored from the original texts.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
