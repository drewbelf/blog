            <p>I thought it might be fun at the end of each month to list the movies I&rsquo;d seen that month &amp; some thoughts about each.</p>
<p><em>Rope</em> (Alfred Hitchcock, 1948). Jacqueline &amp; I decided to watch some Hitchcock in honor of Halloween at the end of the month. We&rsquo;ve seen a few Hitchcock already, but not <em>Rope</em>. I enjoyed it, though it&rsquo;s not my favorite of his (that remains <em>Psycho</em>). I love good, long scenes, &amp; Hitchcock&rsquo;s clever camera work to make the entire film seem like a single take really ratchets up the tension.</p>
<p><em>Scream</em> (Wes Craven, 1996). I&rsquo;d seen bits of the recent <em>Scream</em> reboot on someone else&rsquo;s screen on an international flight a couple years ago, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve actually watched a <em>Scream</em> film start to finish. It was great! It was meta without being too in-your-face about it (with maybe an exception or two here or there), &amp; there were some unexpected resonances with <em>Rope</em> (chiefly in the homoerotic subtext between Billy &amp; Stu). The opening sequence is genuinely frightening, &amp; killing off Drew Barrymore at the very beginning is brilliant. I have little interest in the rest of the franchise, but this was a good one.</p>
<p><em>The Greatest Showman</em> (Michael Gracey, 2017). One of my students watched my favorite movie, <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, &amp; insisted I watch this movie in return. I&rsquo;ll confess, I didn&rsquo;t love it. The music really didn&rsquo;t do anything, and the story felt pretty tepid (surprising, considering the actual history of P.T. Barnum&rsquo;s life).</p>
<p><em>The Birds</em> (Alfred Hitchcock, 1963). Another Hitchcock in honor of Halloween month. Amazing how threatening Hitchcock makes birds seem&mdash;the scene as the birds gather outside the schoolhouse!&mdash;&amp; how he used <em>real birds</em> for almost the entire movie.</p>
<p><em>A Serious Man</em> (Joel Coen &amp; Ethan Coen, 2009). I watched this movie as a candidate for the <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com/2023/10/30/ive-been-spending.html" target="_blank">theology &amp; film course I&rsquo;m designing</a>. I think it&rsquo;ll make the syllabus. The film obviously engages the book of Job but also has some pretty significant differences. I think it will make for great discussion, to bring this film into dialogue with its source material.</p>
<p><em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> (Wes Craven, 1984). Another Wes Craven to finish out October. I thought this was pretty good, though I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it as much as <em>Scream</em>. It had some creepy sequences but I think I really only jumped once or twice (&amp; I tend to be very jumpy during scary movies). I liked Nancy&rsquo;s character. That last sequence was very confusing though (&amp; apparently an addition at the insistence of the producer). I&rsquo;d like to see <em>Wes Craven&rsquo;s New Nightmare</em> now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hoped to see <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> this month, but it was a very busy month at work. I&rsquo;m planning to see it in the next week or so.</p>
