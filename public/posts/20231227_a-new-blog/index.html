            <p>When I started <a href="https://micro.andrewbelfield.com" target="_blank">micro blogging</a> in 2021, I never planned to do anything but that: micro blog. I&rsquo;d tried to blog before&mdash;my first website was a static site generated by Jekyll&mdash;but it had never stuck. I liked the idea of instead having a fairly low-effort, ephemeral site: a blog populated with posts about what I&rsquo;m reading, quotations I&rsquo;m mulling over, even some pictures, etc. For a while that&rsquo;s all I did with micro.blog.</p>
<p>But then, a little less than a year ago, I began writing some longer posts. These posts grew out of <a href="/posts/20230423_love-restores-the-world-to-order">some reading slightly related to my research</a>, &amp; <a href="/posts/20230427_freely-given-gratefully-received">some teaching</a>, &amp; <a href="/posts/20230623_on-teaching-francis-clare">a talk I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t publish anywhere</a>. I found I liked writing these longer posts. It was helpful to work through some ideas in writing, &amp; it was nice to share some pieces I&rsquo;d written that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be shared. But I didn&rsquo;t quite like having those posts on micro.blog. These longer posts were not full-on essays but they were certainly more substantial than the more frequent, much shorter posts that made up most of my micro.blog. I didn&rsquo;t want my longer posts to fall away into obsurity.</p>
<p>So, I decided to set up a blog (this blog) for those longer posts. It took me a little while to get it together&mdash;in part because of the busyness of the fall semester &amp; in part because I took my a while to settle on <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-rocinante/" target="_blank">a Hugo theme I liked</a>&mdash;but I&rsquo;m excited to start using this new blog. I&rsquo;ve transferred all my longer posts from micro.blog over to here, &amp; I hope to post to this blog at least once a week or so (but we&rsquo;ll see how things go). As for my micro.blog, I&rsquo;ll keep posting there as I have been for the last couple years: books I&rsquo;m reading, quotations, links, pictures, &amp; the like. This blog will be for more extended thoughts&mdash;at least a paragraph&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d had my micro.blog located at <code>blog dot andrew belfield dot com</code> because I never intended to have anything more than a micro.blog, &amp; so the <code>blog</code> subdomain seemed appropriate to use there. Now that I have a proper blog, however, I&rsquo;ve decided to reassign that subdomain to this blog, &amp; I&rsquo;ve given my micro.blog a new subdomain: <code>micro</code>. I know that&rsquo;s confusing&mdash;what was located at <code>blog dot andrew belfield dot com</code> is now located at <code>micro dot andrew belfield dot com</code>, &amp; <code>blog dot andrew belfield dot com</code> is now an entirely new site&mdash;but these subdomains seem to make the most sense for what these sites have become.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to eventually figure out ways of making the site more navigable&mdash;making the tags easier to access, maybe, or incorporating a search function&mdash;but I&rsquo;m very pleased with it for now. &amp; in any case, much as I enjoy tinkering with the site, I&rsquo;m ready to start writing.</p>
