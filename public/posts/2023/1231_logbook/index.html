            <p>In which I read <em>Bullshit Jobs: A Theory</em> &amp; <em>Swimming in the Dark</em> &amp; <em>Silence: A Novel</em> &amp; <em>Way Back to God: The Spiritual Theology of St Bonaventure</em> &amp; <em>Doppleganger: A Trip into the Mirror World</em>; &amp; watched <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> &amp; <em>May December</em> &amp; <em>The Holdovers</em> &amp; <em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes</em> &amp; <em>Napoleon</em> &amp; <em>The Muppets Christmas Carol</em> &amp; <em>Home Alone</em> &amp; <em>Poor Things</em> &amp; <em>It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life</em> &amp; <em>Saltburn</em> &amp; <em>The Color Purple</em> (2023).</p>
<p><em>Bullshit Jobs: A Theory</em> (David Graeber, 2018). (Technically I finished this on the last day of November, but as I finished it after posting November&rsquo;s logbook I&rsquo;m listing it here.) I&rsquo;m not quite sure what to make of this book. Graeber offers a number of useful insights when it comes to the fact that many people seem to be doing a lot of pointless work; I especially appreciated the way he distinguished productive labor from caring labor. But the theory of bullshit jobs&mdash;that almost half the population works jobs that offer no value to society&mdash;seems to be based on speculation more than anything else. Part of the issue for me is that a bullshit job is determined by if the person doing the job feels the job is bullshit. Graeber acknowledges &amp; defends the subjective nature of his definition: basically, people know their own work best &amp; so are in the best position to judge whether the job is bullshit or not. &amp; maybe so. But I wonder whether that speculation justifies the kind of work he does in the book. Even if its foundations strike me as a little shaky, I still think the book is worth reading, especially for the later chapters.</p>
<p><em>Swimming in the Dark</em> (Tomasz Jedrowski, 2020). I didn&rsquo;t find this as engaging as I&rsquo;d hoped. Part of the problem, I&rsquo;m sure, is the fact that I listened to it on audiobook &amp; that I sometimes had to take long breaks from listening, so my encounter with the story was somewhat disjointed. I liked the way <em>Giovanni&rsquo;s Room</em> cropped up throughout the narrative, &amp; were I to read this again I&rsquo;d be paying attention to how <em>Giovanni&rsquo;s Room</em> &amp; <em>Swimming in the Dark</em> rhyme.</p>
<p><em>Silence: A Novel</em> (Shūsaku Endō, 1966). One of my absolute favorite books, which I&rsquo;ve read at least three times now. On this read I was especially struck at Rodrigues&rsquo;s attitude toward the Japanese Christians. He regards them as little more than children, helpless without his priestly paternalism. But Rodrigues is wrong about this&mdash;the Japanese Christians show themselves to be devoted Christians with or without priests, organizing their own ecclesial communities &amp; even enduring martyrdom. Much of what Rodrigues must do over the course of the story, then, is relearn what it means to be a priest.</p>
<p><em>Way Back to God: The Spiritual Theology of St Bonaventure</em> (Douglas Dales, 2019). I&rsquo;d hoped I could use this as a textbook for my &ldquo;Bonaventure&mdash;Life &amp; Writings&rdquo; course, but I don&rsquo;t think it will work. Dales shows deep familiarity with the writings of Bonaventure, but the book assumes a little more theological knowledge of its readers than I think I can expect of my students. Still, <em>Way Back to God</em> offers a helpful orientation to Bonaventure&rsquo;s writings as a whole.</p>
<p><em>Doppleganger: A Trip into the Mirror World</em> (Naomi Klein, 2023). I only just finished this yesterday so I&rsquo;m still sorting through my thoughts. The Doppleganger throughline often opened up fascinating perspectives on modern politics &amp; society, though at times the metaphor felt a little strained. I admire how Klein does not merely dismiss those living in &ldquo;the mirror world&rdquo; (anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, QAnon devotees, etc.) out of hand. She acknowledges that they have good reaosn to be frustrated with &amp; suspicious toward governments &amp; elites, but those frustrations &amp; suspicions often get misdirected &amp; coopted by systems of capital. The last part of the book offers very helpful reflections on solidarity &amp; care (dovetailing, to some degree, with Graeber&rsquo;s <em>Bullshit Jobs</em>).</p>
<p><em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> (John Ford, 1940). Number 23 on <a href="https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies/" target="_blank">the AFI&rsquo;s list of Top 100 films</a> (which Jacqueline &amp; I are about 75% of the way through!). A moving set of vignettes on how poverty degrades the poor, without being (I thought) too oversensationalized about it. Plus, it&rsquo;s a rare pro-union film (compare it to films like <em>On the Waterfront</em> or <em>The Godfather</em>). Henry Fonda delivers a very strong performance.</p>
<p><em>May December</em> (Todd Haynes, 2023). I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what to make of this. I enjoyed Natalie Portman&rsquo;s performance as a frankly bad actress who gets much too involved in the lives of her subject &amp; her subject&rsquo;s family. Most affecting, though, was Charles Melton&rsquo;s performance, particularly toward the end of the film. He must be a contender for an Academy Award.</p>
<p><em>The Holdovers</em> (Alexander Payne, 2023). A heartwarming, if somewhat familiar, film about a group of misfits who are forced to become something of a family together. I thought the film did a good job of showing how pain &amp; tragedy often lie just below the surface of our actions.</p>
<p><em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes</em> (Francis Lawrence, 2023). This was enjoyable enough&mdash;I&rsquo;m a bit of a sucker for this sort of dystopian literature/film&mdash;but not particularly good.</p>
<p><em>Napoleon</em> (Ridley Scott, 2023). I&rsquo;m not a big Joaquin Phoenix guy, but this was a great performance. He presents Napoleon as an overweening, boasting, but ultimately smaller-than-life bully. (You can draw your own comparisons to contemporary political figures.) The film is less interested in what made Napoleon a charismatic leader or a military genius than in the destruction he wrought in his wake. At first I thought that was a shortcoming of the film, but now I see that that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p><em>The Muppets Christmas Carol</em> (Brian Henson, 1992). This is, I think, my favorite Christmas movie. <em>A Christmas Carol</em> is an excellent Christmas ghost story, of course, &amp; the juxtaposition between Michael Caine&rsquo;s totally straight acting against the antics of the Muppets is so funny.</p>
<p><em>Home Alone</em> (Chris Columbus, 1990). I really do not care for this movie but it&rsquo;s a favorite of Jacqueline&rsquo;s, so we watched it in the days leading up to Christmas. Macaulay Culkin is incredibly charming in the lead.</p>
<p><em>Poor Things</em> (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2023). This movie was extremely disappointing. The performances all around were strong &amp; the production design was distinct &amp; consistent (if a bit wearying). But this tale, a <em>Frankenstein</em>-inspired <em>Bildungsroman</em> of a young woman named Bella (Emma Stone), is only interested in Bella&rsquo;s sexual liberation &amp; sexual growth, to the almost complete exclusion of any other liberation or growth. The film is so singularly focused on sex that there&rsquo;s no room for anything else. A real missed opportunity.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life</em> (Frank Capra, 1946). I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve seen this, but what I was most struck by on this viewing is how the film isn&rsquo;t really about George at all&mdash;rather, it&rsquo;s about his community. George spends the entire film thinking his community is too small for him, &amp; that the greatness he seeks can be found only in what is grand. What saves him in the end is not the singular greatness of a rich man like Henry Potter&mdash;who of course, is not great at all&mdash;but the more mundane greatness of his community. This is what makes his life wonderful&mdash;not his accomplishments or the sights he&rsquo;s seen or even the people he&rsquo;s helped, but rather the community that enriches his life with more than just money.</p>
<p><em>Saltburn</em> (Emerald Fennell, 2023). Like <em>Poor Things</em>, this was very disappointing. I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect (I knew basically nothing about the film going in) but the film seems much more interested in shocking its audience than in saying anything clear. I suppose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/movies/saltburn-review.html" target="_blank">Wesley Morris&rsquo;s pan</a> is the closest you can do to identifying the film&rsquo;s theme&mdash;&ldquo;toxic elitism&rdquo;&mdash;but even that&rsquo;s strained at best.</p>
<p><em>The Color Purple</em> (Blitz Bazawule, 2023). Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, &amp; Danielle Brooks&rsquo;s performances really shine in <em>The Color Purple</em>. The final act of the movie feels a bit rushed&mdash;some character growths don&rsquo;t feel quite earned&mdash;which saps the movie of some of its emotional impact. But on the whole, this film is a moving story about resilience &amp; solidarity in the face of adversity &amp; trauma.</p>
