            <p><em><a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20231218_fiducia-supplicans_en.html" target="_blank">Fiducia supplicans</a></em> presents itself as &ldquo;an innovative contriution <em>to the pastoral meaning of blessings</em>, permitting a broadening &amp; enrichment of the classical understanding of blessings&rdquo; (emphasis original). <a href="/posts/20231223_fiducia-supplicans-church-teaching/">I have already said something about how this &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; might fit into a Catholic theological project, particularly where doctrinal development is concerned</a>. I&rsquo;d like now to comment more broadly on the document itself &amp; what it has to say about blessings of couples. My main takeaway from <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> is that all persons &amp; couples, including but not only those couples whose relationships do not conform to the church&rsquo;s expectations, stand in need of God&rsquo;s love &amp; mercy, &amp; so spontaneous, frequent, &amp; abundant blessing of all persons &amp; couples ought to be a regular feature of the church&rsquo;s life as &ldquo;sacrament of God&rsquo;s infinite love&rdquo; (§43).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As I read it, the key portion of <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> &amp; its theology of blessing is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One who asks for a blessing show himself to be in need of God’s saving presence in his life &amp; one who asks for a blessing from the Church recognizes the latter as a sacrament of the salvation that God offers. To seek a blessing in the Church is to acknowledge that the life of the Church springs from the womb of God’s mercy &amp; helps us to move forward, to live better, &amp; to respond to the Lord’s will. &hellip; This request [for a blessing] should, in every way, be valued, accompanied, &amp; received with gratitude. People who come spontaneously to ask for a blessing show by this request their sincere openness to transcendence, the confidence of their hearts that they do not trust in their own strength alone, their need for God, &amp; their desire to break out of the narrow confines of this world, enclosed in its limitations. (§§20&ndash;21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, one who seeks a blessing recognizes their own need for God&rsquo;s love &amp; mercy in their lives, &amp; they recognize the church as a means by which God conveys that love &amp; mercy. Such a recognition is always good &amp; so should always be affirmed. One needn&rsquo;t be morally perfect to receive a blessing (§12), &amp; so it is not necessary or even appropriate for a priest to perform some &ldquo;moral analysis&rdquo; on the petitioner before performing such a blessing (§25). Rather, a priest shold respond to a plea for blessing with a blessing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, though <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> focuses its attention on blessings for couples who do not conform to the church&rsquo;s ideal for marriage, this account of blessing does not apply only to those couples. Rather, <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> recongizes that <em>all</em> persons &amp; couples require God&rsquo;s love &amp; mercy, &amp; so the church &amp; its ministers ought to be prepared to offer frequent &amp; spontaneous blessings when approached. The &ldquo;spontaneity&rdquo; of blessing finds a striking emphasis in <em>Fiducia supplicans</em>; see §§21, 23, 28, 35, 36, &amp; 38.</p>
<p>In addition to a recommendation of frequent &amp; spontaneous blessing, I also noted the way the document characterizes the blessing that descends from God upon couples. Such a blessing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>descends from God upon those who&mdash;recognizing themselves to be destitute &amp; in need of his help&mdash;do not claim a legitimation of their own status, but who beg that all that is true, good, &amp; humanly valid in their lives &amp; their relationships be enriched, healed, &amp; elevated by the presence of the Holy Spirit. (§31)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Fiducia supplicans</em>, here as elsewhere, is careful to note that asking for &amp; receiving a blessing does not &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; the &ldquo;status&rdquo; of the relationship. I take it this mention of &ldquo;status&rdquo; refers to the &ldquo;irregular&rdquo; situation (that&rsquo;s <em>Fiducia supplicans</em>&rsquo;s language) of couples who do not conform to the church&rsquo;s ideal for marriage. Blessing a couple, <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> clarifies, does not necessarily entail recognizing in that couple the sacrament of marriage (see §§24, 39). I have more to say about this, hopefully in a future post.</p>
<p>Though <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> turns quickly from that clarification to the couple&rsquo;s recognition that they are &ldquo;destitute &amp; in need of God&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; that recognition needn&rsquo;t be a recognition that their relationship is somehow illegitimate becuase it does not conform to the church&rsquo;s understanding of marriage. Instead, I read this line as simply repeating what <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> has already affirmed: all humans sin&mdash;all humans, often in spite of themselves, alienate &amp; dehumanize others, even those very close to them&mdash;&amp; so all humans stand in need God&rsquo;s grace.  All couples, married &ldquo;regularly&rdquo; or not, need God&rsquo;s love &amp; mercy.</p>
<p>But I am more interested, anyway, in the latter half of that quotation: <em>Fidcuia supplicans</em> affirms that when a couple seeks a blessing, they are asking &ldquo;that all that is true, good, &amp; humanly valid in their lives <em>&amp; their relationships</em> be enriched, healed, &amp; elevated by the presence of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (emphasis mine). <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> affirms that there <em>is</em> truth &amp; goodness in a couple whose relationship does not conform to the church&rsquo;s ideal for marriage, including in the relationship itself, &amp; God can &ldquo;enrich, heal, &amp; elevate&rdquo; those relationships by God&rsquo;s presence. A little later <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> states that a request for a blessing &ldquo;expresses &amp; nurtures openness to the transcendence, mercy, &amp; closeness of God in a thousand concrete circumstances of life&rdquo; (§33). To ask for a blessing is to be open to God&rsquo;s nearness in the specific situation of the couple, that is, in their relationship.</p>
<p>In other words, <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> affirms that God is present to queer couples in their relationship! That God can be present to a couple whose relationship does not conform to the church&rsquo;s understanding of marriage is, of course, obvious to any loving couple &amp; to those who know &amp; love such couples. But for a document signed by the pope to recognize this, too, is significant&mdash;this, I take it, is what is innovative about <em>Fiducia supplicans</em>.</p>
<p><em>Fiducia supplicans</em> wants to be clear that blessings of couples who do not conform to the church&rsquo;s understanding of marriage are pastoral, not liturgical, blessings (see §§24, 33, 38, 39). But this is a perplexing distinction: as my friend &amp; colleague, an expert on Catholic liturgy, sacramental theology, &amp; ecclesiology, observed, <em><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html" target="_blank">Lumen gentium</a></em> identifies the liturgy as &ldquo;the source &amp; summit of the whole of Christian life&rdquo; (§11). Indeed, Víctor Manuel Cardinal Fernández, prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, in his prologue to <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> observes that &ldquo;the broadening &amp; enrichment&rdquo; of blessings that <em>Fidcuia supplicans</em> accomplishes &ldquo;is closely linked to a liturgical perspective.&rdquo; How can any pastoral activity of the church be divided from the liturgical origins &amp; destination of the church?</p>
<p>There is, of course, much more to say about <em>Fiducia supplicans</em> &amp; its implications for the life of the church. But on the whole I am pretty encouraged by its theology of blessing &amp; its recognition that God&rsquo;s love &amp; mercy is available to all couples who seek it.</p>
