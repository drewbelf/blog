            <p>In the very year of our engagement, <em>Lady Bird</em> was released.<br>
Toward the end of this magnanimous film<br>
the titular character meets with her English teacher, Sister Sarah Joan,<br>
to discuss a short story she wrote for class.<br>
That wise nun comments how clearly<br>
Lady Bird‚Äôs love for Sacramento comes through,<br>
much to Lady Bird‚Äôs‚Äîand the viewer‚Äôs‚Äîsurprise.<br>
Up till now we have seen Lady Bird straining<br>
at the borders of her hometown<br>
and dreaming of going to college<br>
where there is, as she puts it, ‚Äúculture‚Äù‚Äî<br>
somewhere like New York City,<br>
or at least, she says naively, Connecticut.<br>
Unwilling to call what she feels for Sacramento love,<br>
Lady Bird demurs, saying,<br>
‚ÄúI guess I pay attention.‚Äù
Sister Sarah Joan, sage-like, responds,<br>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think maybe they are the same thing?<br>
Love &amp; attention?‚Äù</p>
<p>Jacqueline,<br>
whom I now have the great &amp; singular joy to call my wife,<br>
is someone who pays attention.<br>
How else to explain her acute focus,<br>
an enviable ability to block out all distractions &amp; interruptions?<br>
How else to explain her fascination with<br>
and appreciation for art in all its forms,<br>
her own deeply-felt artistic expression in song &amp; in dance?<br>
Indeed it is by this very attention<br>
that Jacqueline sees the world insightfully &amp; perceptively,<br>
that she recognizes with clarity the virtues &amp; vices &amp; motivations<br>
of those whom she encounters in life &amp; in literature.<br>
I recall our earliest conversations at St. Bonaventure,<br>
where we sat in Hickey Dining Hall<br>
long after our plates had been emptied &amp; our stomachs filled,<br>
as we canvassed literature, film, television, and, most of all, music.<br>
Though I did not realize it at the time,<br>
what drew me to her,<br>
besides her evident beauty‚Äî<br>
and the prospect of dating a third-generation SBU legacy‚Äî<br>
was her keen sense of the world, borne out of a piercing eye.<br>
It was breathtaking,<br>
enlightening,<br>
challenging,<br>
delighting.</p>
<p>In what can only be called a miracle of divine grace,<br>
Jacqueline has turned her attentive gaze to me.<br>
To be beheld by Jacqueline is thrilling.<br>
She is a source of comfort,<br>
sharing in my hopes &amp; joys, my griefs &amp; anxieties.<br>
She provides refuge from the lonely, isolating, solitary world I inhabit<br>
of dusty books &amp; long-forgotten names.<br>
Under her eyes, I am not anonymous;<br>
I am seen.<br>
But to be beheld by Jacqueline can be frightening indeed.<br>
Jacqueline sees right through all my pretenses,<br>
through the false self by which I delude<br>
(or attempt to delude)<br>
the world &amp; myself.<br>
She knows when I complain about my colleagues<br>
I really give voice to my own insecurities.<br>
She knows my impatience with others<br>
only masks my own frustration with myself.<br>
I cannot but read myself into<br>
the lover of the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song&#43;of&#43;Songs&#43;2%3A8-10%2C&#43;14%2C&#43;16a%3B&#43;8%3A6-7a&amp;version=NABRE" target="_blank">Song of Songs</a>;<br>
in the eyes of his beloved, he delights:<br>
‚ÄúHow beautiful you are, my love, how beautiful!<br>
Your eyes are doves!‚Äù (1:15).<br>
But from those very eyes, he shrinks:<br>
‚ÄúTurn your eyes away from me, for they disturb me‚Äù (6:5).<br>
Jacqueline sees me, &amp; so I delight.<br>
Yet it is precisely because she sees me that I cower,<br>
for she misses nothing‚Äî<br>
not my shame, nor my sin.</p>
<p>Jacqueline,<br>
in other words,<br>
sees me not only as I am now‚Äî<br>
sinful indeed &amp; a poor excuse for a Christian‚Äî<br>
but also as I could be; rather, as I should be.<br>
Her probing stare exhorts me to be who I am created to be‚Äî<br>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew&#43;5%3A1-12a&amp;version=NABRE" target="_blank">poor in spirit &amp; meek</a>,<br>
hungering &amp; thirsting for justice,<br>
clean of heart &amp; peacemaking.<br>
Sometimes she does this outright,<br>
gently &amp; charitably chiding me when I deserve it‚Äî<br>
but most times it is her modeling of Christian discipleship,<br>
her lived embodiment of those beatitudes<br>
that points me away from sin &amp; darkness<br>
and toward righteousness &amp; light.<br>
Saint Francis of Assisi is attributed as saying,<br>
‚ÄúPreach the Gospel always;<br>
when necessary, use words.‚Äù<br>
Though he surely uttered no such thing,<br>
Jacqueline lives that proverb ceaselessly.</p>
<p>Indulge me still further.<br>
Marriage,<br>
as a sacrament in the Catholic sense,<br>
is shaped &amp; normed by the cross.<br>
In all sacraments, no less marriage,<br>
we die on the cross with Christ,<br>
and with him leave behind an empty tomb.<br>
In our sacramental dying &amp; rising<br>
is anticipated our physical dying &amp; rising.<br>
Every time a sinner submits to baptism‚Äôs watery grave,<br>
every time the one bloody sacrifice is celebrated<br>
with the unbloody words <em>hoc est corpus meum</em>,<br>
every time two persons die to their selves<br>
and consent to the union in which they rise together as one,<br>
Death‚Äôs claim over us is broken.<br>
This is God‚Äôs wisdom, foolishness to the world,<br>
that by Death itself God should bring life.<br>
Rightly does the Apostle Paul‚Äîand do we‚Äî<br>
rejoice with words mocking:<br>
‚ÄúWhere, O Death, is your sting?‚Äù</p>
<p>Put otherwise,<br>
the process of dying &amp; rising in the sacraments<br>
is nothing other than the process of entering into eternal life,<br>
wherein the last enemy Death finally is defeated.<br>
To be married in this life is to be made ready<br>
for <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation&#43;19&amp;version=NABRE" target="_blank">the wedding-feast in the life to come</a>,<br>
where we all shall be wedded to the Lamb whose victory the cross is.<br>
In my marital, sacramental life with Jacqueline,<br>
and under the clear, precise, charitable, demanding gaze<br>
by which Jacqueline attends to me,<br>
I work out the salvation Christ has wrought.<br>
I am not saved except for her love,<br>
that is to say her <em>attention</em>,<br>
a love &amp; attention that reform me<br>
not in in her image or in mine,<br>
but in the image of the LORD.<br>
This is God‚Äôs providential plan for me;<br>
these are the means by which God,<br>
in His mercy,<br>
has ordained that I shall be saved.<br>
It could not be otherwise.<br>
Without Jacqueline I turn my face from His face,<br>
to my own peril;<br>
with her, I shall look upon the face of the LORD as a friend,<br>
in life eternal.<br>
I know not why God has entrusted her to my care‚Äî<br>
for I, as Jacqueline‚Äôs spouse, must do the same for her‚Äî<br>
but thanks be that God has seen fit to entrust me to hers.</p>
