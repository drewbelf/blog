<p>&lsquo;What do you keep on arguing for? I&rsquo;m only telling you the sort of chap I am. I only want my rights. I&rsquo;m not asking for anybody&rsquo;s bleeding charity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then do. At once. Ask for the Bleeding Charity. Everything is here for the asking &amp; nothing can be bought.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of my favorite exchanges in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780061947353" target="_blank">C. S. Lewis&rsquo;s <em>The Great Divorce</em></a>. Here the &ldquo;Big Man&rdquo; (the first speaker) is insisting on his own decency in his earthly life&mdash;ironic considering the reader is introduced to the Big Man when he beats a man up to take his place in the line for the bus to Heaven&mdash;&amp; how Heaven is therefore his &ldquo;by rights.&rdquo; Len (his guide to Heaven &amp; apparently a former employee of the Big Man&rsquo;s) keeps trying to dissuade him from thinking about Heaven as a matter of deserts.</p>
<p>This is something I encounter, semester after semester, in my students’ thinking about Heaven &amp; Hell: it must be a matter of what one deserves. But as Len himself notes, no one in Heaven gets what they deserve: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad as that. I haven&rsquo;t got my rights, or I should not be here. You will not get yours either. You&rsquo;ll get something far better. Never fear.&rdquo; No one is really good enough to actually <em>deserve</em> the joys of Heaven; this is not so much a comment on the smallness of human goodness as a comment on the largeness of Heaven&rsquo;s joys.</p>
<p>If Heaven is a matter of being eternally enfolded into the love of God&mdash;into the love that <em>is</em> God&mdash;then it cannot be the case that Heaven is a matter of just deserts. That&rsquo;s not only because humans have a self-destructive tendency to turn from love when they encounter it (Len again: &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t a decent man &amp; you didn&rsquo;t do your best. We none of us were &amp; none of us did. Lord bless you, it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;), but also because <em>that&rsquo;s not how love works</em>. Love is not something earned or merited: it is a gift, freely given &amp; gratefully received.</p>
<p>To think about Heaven as something someone earns&mdash;as a reward for good behavior&mdash;is to go about it all wrong. But if we think about Heaven instead as God&rsquo;s offer of self in love, well, now we&rsquo;re on to something.</p>
