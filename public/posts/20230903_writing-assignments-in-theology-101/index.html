            <p>(Well, not quite Theology 101; rather, <a href="https://blog.andrewbelfield.com/posts/20230623_on-teaching-francis-clare" target="_blank">Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies 101</a>, which isn&rsquo;t exactly an intro to theology.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finally getting close to a &ldquo;final form&rdquo; for my sections of <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/general-education-curriculum/learning-goals-objectives" target="_blank">&ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.‚Äù</a> The course schedule, including reading assignments, is mostly set, but what&rsquo;s really tied together the entire course is the integration of a service learning project throughout the semester.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, students take what they learn about Franciscan values to design, plan, &amp; implement a service project that does some good for the local community. Afterwards they will write a reflective essay in which they discuss their experience of service in connection with key themes &amp; ideas from the course. I was inspired to work this project into my course by my colleague, who had used service learning in the past, &amp; students responded well to the project last semester. This semester I&rsquo;ve worked to more fully integrate the project into my course, mainly by orienting all the other writing assignments in the course to the service learning project.</p>
<p>Early in the semester, students will write a short essay articulating their understanding of &ldquo;Franciscan service,&rdquo; on the basis of a couple of readings we&rsquo;ll discuss in class (including selections of Pope Francis&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html" target="_blank">Fratelli tutti</a></em>). This writing assignment will ask them to consider the difference between service &amp; solidarity, &amp; how they might embody solidarity in their own acts of service. This early writing assignment will help students begin to think about service in a Franciscan key, &amp; what they might want to do for their service project. (We&rsquo;ll also have time in class to brainstorm ideas &amp; begin planning projects.)</p>
<p>Later on in the semester students will complete an in-class positionality mapping exercise (I learned a lot about this from <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1609406919870075" target="_blank">Danielle Jacobson&rsquo;s &amp; Nida Mustafa&rsquo;s paper on social identity mapping</a>), which will form the basis of their second writing assignment. I don&rsquo;t ask students to share with me anything about their social position they&rsquo;re not comfortable sharing, but I do ask them to reflect in writing on how their social position informs their own particular worldview. That includes possible blind spots they may have as a consequence of their social position; that also includes a unique perspective or insight about the world they have thanks to their social position. My hope&mdash;&amp; I&rsquo;ll be explicit about this in class&mdash;is that students will think about the position <em>from which</em> they engage in service. What is it about their social location that puts them in a position to do service at all? How do their intersecting social positions inform they kind of good they want to do in their community?</p>
<p>Then, in the latter half of the semester, students will write a couple short essays on Franciscan values. I&rsquo;ve already identified most of the possible values (e.g., non-possessiveness, fraternal living, universal kinship, peacemaking, etc.); students will choose one, find a quotation from Francis or Clare to illustrate it, &amp; then explain the value. These will come into play when students are reflecting on their experience in the service learning project.</p>
<p>Finally, for the end of the semester students write a reflective essay drawing on their experience completing the service learning project. The reflective essay has a few parts to it. I&rsquo;ll ask them to think about to what extent their service learning project met the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; of Franciscan service they set in their first writing assignment. Students won&rsquo;t be graded on how &ldquo;Franciscan&rdquo; their project was; rather, I want students to think about how service does &amp; does not allow for the &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;&mdash;the change of social position&mdash;that Francis &amp; Clare lived in their own time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also ask students to think about how their social position may have shaped their experience of doing service. The goal here is that putting service in the context of one&rsquo;s social position will discourage the &ldquo;it felt so good to help someone&rdquo; attitude toward service, which I worry is patronizing &amp; shortcircuits questions about why we live in a world where such service is needed. Instead, I&rsquo;d like students to think more critically about themselves &amp; society&mdash;what about their privilege positions them to do service like this? How might students choose to live in ways that counteract the societal arrangements that marginalize or oppress people?</p>
<p>Students will further reflect on Franciscan values in connection with their experience of service. They might use what we learned in the classroom to analyze &amp; interpret their experience, or they might use their experience to shed new light on the ideas learned &amp; discussed in class.</p>
<p>The reflective essay, then, draws upon each of the previous writing assignments while asking students to rethink some of their earlier thoughts in light of the service experience. I hope this project gives a clear throughline to the course as a whole; I hope, too, that it conveys to students the nature of learning as cumulative &amp; always needing revision. (I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a more elegant way to say that.) Basically: knowledge&mdash;in all its forms&mdash;builds &amp; often requires us to adjust what we previously thought about the world.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve done this service learning project before, this is the first time I&rsquo;m teaching it as a fully integrated component of the course. I&rsquo;m excited to see how it goes.</p>
