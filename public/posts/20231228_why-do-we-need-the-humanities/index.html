<blockquote>
<p>[Kelly] Chezum [Clarkson&rsquo;s vice president for external relations] said the university has always been focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The nine majors being phased out — social documentation, history, literature, sociology, film, political science, digital arts and sciences, communications and media, and interdisciplinary liberal studies and humanities — represent less than 2% of students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very often when programs in the humanities are cut, the cuts are justified&mdash;explicitly or not&mdash;by pointing out how few students will be affected by these cuts. The &ldquo;vice president for external relations&rdquo; here points out that Clarkson has historically been more of a STEM school anyway &amp; that only a very small percentage of students are members of the programs being cut. The suggestion, then, is that Clarkson students aren&rsquo;t really getting hurt in all this&mdash;there are hardly any students choosing these majors in the first place, &amp; those students will be allowed to finish their degreem programs before the programs are fully phased out. This sort of reasoning seems to be fairly typical when humanities are cut: students aren&rsquo;t majoring in the humanities, so why do we need them?</p>
<p>I find this kind of reasoning frustrating for a lot of reasons, chief among them that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/02/opinion/humanities-liberal-arts-policy-higher-education.html" target="_blank">there is more to a college education than vocational training</a>. In fairness to Clarkson it has not announced any plans to cut or scale back its general education curriculum, so its non-humanities students will have to take classes that are ordered to deep &amp; critical thinking. But what does it say to a university&rsquo;s students when that university cuts its programs in the humanities&mdash;those fields that are primarily interested in questions of ultimate meaning &amp; significance, particularly where human existence &amp; shared life are concerned&mdash;about the importance of such questions?</p>
