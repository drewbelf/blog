        I&rsquo;ve seen a fair amount of hand wringing over Fiducia supplicans where the consistency of church teaching &amp; papal authority are concerned. The concern goes something like this: Pope Francis, while reaffirming the Catholic church&rsquo;s historical teaching on marriage (as possible only between a woman &amp; a man), has allowed for the blessing of a same-sex couple (but not their relationship). This means the Catholic church will have to either forge ahead, perhaps revising its understanding of marriage to include same-sex unions, or pull back from Fiducia supplicans to reaffirm its historical understanding of marriage.

        It was winter in Italy, eight hundred years ago, &amp; Assisi’s poverello had an idea.1 Francis of Assisi had become obsessed with the words &amp; deeds of Jesus Christ, his rustic parables &amp; simple gestures that, despite (or perhaps because of) their lowliness, communicated divine majesty &amp; awe. According to an early biographer,2 “so thoroughly did the humility of the incarnation &amp; the charity of the passion occupy his memory that he scarcely wanted to think of anything else.

Killers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023). What an amazing film. I don&rsquo;t even want to say much about it here, because I know I can&rsquo;t do it justice in the space of a short paragraph.

        (Well, not quite Theology 101; rather, Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies 101, which isn&rsquo;t exactly an intro to theology.)
I&rsquo;m finally getting close to a &ldquo;final form&rdquo; for my sections of &ldquo;The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” The course schedule, including reading assignments, is mostly set, but what&rsquo;s really tied together the entire course is the integration of a service learning project throughout the semester.
Throughout the semester, students take what they learn about Franciscan values to design, plan, &amp; implement a service project that does some good for the local community.

        I really enjoyed both Barbie &amp; Oppenheimer; I plan to see both again soon, but some initial thoughts:
Barbie is just so fun to watch, start to finish. The production design is stunningly detailed, the writing is weird &amp; funny, &amp; Ryan Gosling &amp; Margot Robbie both deliver wonderful performances&mdash;Gosling&rsquo;s wonderfully funny, &amp; Robbie&rsquo;s wonderfully subtle. Greta Gerwig adds another film to her already impressive body of work in this sensitive &amp; delightful reflection on the human project of making meaning in the face of uncertainty &amp; death.

        How to teach a course on Francis &amp; Clare of Assisi?1 The 101 class offered by the Department of Theology &amp; Franciscan Studies at St. Bonaventure University is titled “The Way of Francis &amp; Clare.” This course aims to introduce students to the Franciscan roots that underlie the mission &amp; values of SBU by a semester-long study of the lives &amp; writings of Francis &amp; Clare.
Teaching such a course is not without its challenges.

        I admire the aim in Elizabeth Johnson&rsquo;s Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril: to produce a theology that considers how Jesus&rsquo;s life, death, &amp; resurrection are good news for the whole cosmos, particularly in the context of ecological crisis. &amp; while I don&rsquo;t disagree with some of the conclusions (presented chiefly in book 6), ironically the particularity of Jesus&rsquo;s life (natal &amp; risen) &amp; his death don&rsquo;t seem to determine the conclusions as much as the work&rsquo;s title might lead one to expect.
